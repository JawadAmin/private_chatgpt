       "\"Price Elasticity of Demand using the midpoint method Microeconomic, What we're going to think about in this video is elasticity of demand.  Elasticity of demand.  And what this is, is a measure of how does the quantity demanded change given a change in price, or how does a change in price impact the quantity demanded.  So change in price impact quantity demanded.  When you talk about demand, you're talking about the whole curve.  Quantity demanded is a specific quantity.  Quantity demanded.  The way that economists measure this is they measure it as a percent change in quantity over the percent change in price.  And the reason why they do this, as opposed to just say change in quantity over change in price, is because if you did change in quantity over change in price, you would have a number that's specific to the units you're using.  So it would depend on whether you're doing quantity in terms of per hour, per week, or per year.  Because of the percentage, you're taking a change in some quantity divided by that quantity.  And the reason why it's called elasticity, this might make some sense to you, or the reason why I like to think it's called elasticity, is I imagine something that's elastic, like an elastic band or a rubber band.  And in a rubber band, if you pull it, dependi\\nPerfect inelasticity and perfect elasticity of demand Microeconomics, To get a better intuition for the price elasticity of demand, I thought I would take a look at some of the more extreme cases and think about what types of elasticities of demand we would see.  So in one column, I'll put price, and in the other column, I will put quantity.  Fair enough.  Now what happens if the price changes? What happens if the price were to go down? Let's say the price were to go down to $1.  And remember, we're holding all else equal.  We're not assuming any change in expectations of price.  They expect price to go up or down or anything like that.  And so you could keep raising price within reason, and they would still buy the same quantity.  Obviously, if you raise it to $1 billion, then they just wouldn't be able to afford it.  So this is an example of perfect inelasticity.  Another way, so if you think of the physical analogy that we talked about with elasticity, it's like a brick.  It doesn't matter how much within reason, once again, any amount of force pulling or pushing that a human could put on a brick, it's not going to deform the brick in any way.  And likewise, any change in price within reason here isn't going to change the demand in any way.  It's perfectly inelastic.  And if y\\nPerfect inelasticity and perfect elasticity of demand Microeconomics,  So this right over here is a vial of insulin.  Many diabetics, not all diabetics, but many diabetics need to take insulin daily.  They need to inject it in order to maintain their blood sugar level.  If they don't do it, bad things will happen to their body, and they might even prematurely die if they don't take their insulin on time.  So let's think about what the elasticity of demand might look like for something like insulin.  So let's say that insulin right now is going for $5 a vial.  We have a group of diabetics who need insulin, and they're all going to buy the insulin they need.  And let's say in this group, that turns out to be 100 vials per week.  So this is in vials per week.  That's exactly what they need to do to maintain their insulin.  Well, what would the quantity be? Well, they're not going to buy any more insulin.  They're going to buy just what they need in order to maintain their diabetes.  So in this case, they'll still just buy 100 vials.  Now what happens if the price went up a ton? What if happens if the price went to $100 a vial? Well, it would be hard for them, but they need it to survive.  So it's going to squeeze out any other expenses that they need to spend money on, and so they s\""
