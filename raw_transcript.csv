And lucky for us, it's a fairly intuitive idea. It just tells us that if we raise the price of a product, that will lower the quantity demanded for the product. Quantity demanded will go down. And you can imagine the other side of that. If we lower the price of a product, that will raise the quantity demanded of that product. And the law of demand says this just kind of generally. What we'll see in a few videos from now is that there are some exceptions to this. But to make this a little concrete, let's think about the demand for a certain product. And one thing I want to clear here, and I'm going to go through great pains to not mess this up, is that when we talk about the word demand in an economic sense, in a formal economic sense, we're not talking about a quantity. We're actually going to talk all else equals, ceteris paribus, all of the relationship between price and quantity demanded. If we talk about an actual quantity, we should say the quantity demanded. So demand versus quantity demanded. These are two different things. And if it's a little confusing to you right now, hopefully by the end of this video, the difference between demand and quantity demanded will become a little bit clearer, and definitely over the next few videos. Because in this video, we're going to focus on how the quantity demanded changes relative to the price. In future videos, we'll talk about how the entire relationship, how demand changes, based on different factors. But to make things concrete, let's say I'm about to release my science fiction book, space whatever, I don't know, the book that I want to release. I'm going to release some e-book. And we've done some market study, or we just know how the price is, or how the demand is related to price, or the price is related to demand. And we're going to show that in a demand schedule, which is really just a table that just shows how the price, and actually I just made my first mistake. I just said how price relates to demand. I should say how price relates to quantity demanded, and how quantity demanded relates to price. So a demand schedule shows a relationship between price and quantity demanded, all else equal. So we're going to have multiple scenarios here. So this column, let me do my scenarios. This column, let me put my price. And this column, let me put my quantity demanded. So scenario A, I could price my book at $2. And I'll get a ton of people downloading it at that price. So I will get 60,000 people download my book at that price, my e-book. Scenario B, I could raise the price by $2. So it's now $4. And then that kills off a lot of the demand. Now the quantity demanded goes down to 40,000 people downloading it. Then I could go to scenario C if I raise by another $2. So now I'm at $6. Now that lowers the quantity demanded to 30,000. I'll do a couple more of these. Scenario D, I raise another $2, so I get to $8 now. Now the quantity demanded goes down to 25,000. And I'll do one more of these. Let's see, what color have I not used yet? I haven't used yellow yet. Scenario E, if I raise it to $10, now the quantity demanded, let's just say it is 23,000. So this relationship between this shows the law of demand right over here, and this table that shows how the quantity demanded relates to price and vice versa, this is what we call a demand schedule. Now we can also, based on this demand schedule, draw a demand curve. And really we're just going to plot these points and draw the curve that connects them, because we don't have to just, these aren't the only scenarios. Anything in between is possible. We could charge $2.01 for the book. We could charge $4.50 for the book. And so that's what the demand curve captures a little bit better, because it's a continuous curve, not just five points. So let's do that. Let's graph it. And this is one of those conventions of economics that I am not a fan of, because people often talk about changing the price and how the quantity demanded changes from that. And in traditional, in most of math and science, the thing that you're changing, you normally put on the horizontal axis. So if I was in charge of the convention of economics, I would plot price on the horizontal axis right over here. But the way it's done typically is that price is done on the vertical axis. And so you're used to seeing it in kind of a traditional class environment. I'll do the same. So we'll put price in the vertical axis, and we'll put quantity demanded in the horizontal axis. And our quantity demanded goes all the way up to 60,000. So let's see, that's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. So that's 10. This is in 1,000. 20, 30, 40, sorry, not 45, 40, 50, and 60. And this is in thousands. And then the price goes up to $10, from $2 to $10. So let's say this is 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. So let's plot the scenarios. So scenario A, price is $2. 60,000 units are demanded. That is scenario A right over there. Scenario B, when the price is $4, 40,000 units are demanded. $4, 40,000 units. That's right over there. That's scenario B. Scenario C, $6, 30,000 units. Right over there, scenario C. Scenario D, $8, 25,000 units. $8.25 is right about there. That looks like 25,000 right in between. That's close enough. So that right over there is scenario D. And then finally, scenario E, $10, 23,000 units. So it might be something like that. That is scenario E. And so we could actually have prices anywhere in between that, and maybe we could even go further. So this right over here, so if I were to draw the demand curve, it could look something like this. The demand curve would look something, I'm trying to do my best to draw it as a straight, continuous line, could look something like that. And it could keep going on and on. And so these are two ways to show demand. So just going back to what I said earlier, the quantity demanded is all else equal for a given price how many units people are willing to download or buy of my e-book. When we talk about the demand itself, we're talking about this entire relationship. So this demand itself is this entire demand schedule. Or another way to think of it is this entire demand curve. If demand were to change, we would actually have a different curve. This curve would shift, or the entries in this table would shift. If the quantity of demand changes, so we move along this curve, when you hold everything else equal, and you only change price. So hopefully that makes that clear. When everything else is equal, and you're only changing price, you're not changing demand, you're changing the quantity demanded. The demand, because everything else is equal, is this relationship. In the next few videos, we'll think about what does happen when you do change some of those other factors."
1,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slP8XZ6Nq40,Price Elasticity of Demand using the midpoint method Microeconomic,"What we're going to think about in this video is elasticity of demand. Elasticity of demand. And what this is, is a measure of how does the quantity demanded change given a change in price, or how does a change in price impact the quantity demanded. So change in price impact quantity demanded. When you talk about demand, you're talking about the whole curve. Quantity demanded is a specific quantity. Quantity demanded. And the way that we as economists, I'm not really an economist, since we're doing economics, we can pretend to be economists. The way that economists measure this is they measure it as a percent change in quantity over the percent change in price. And the reason why they do this, as opposed to just say change in quantity over change in price, is because if you did change in quantity over change in price, you would have a number that's specific to the units you're using. So it would depend on whether you're doing quantity in terms of per hour, per week, or per year. And so you would have different numbers based on the time frame or the units that you might use. But when you use a percentage, it is a unitless number. Because of the percentage, you're taking a change in some quantity divided by that quantity. So the units themselves actually cancel out. And the reason why it's called elasticity, this might make some sense to you, or the reason why I like to think it's called elasticity, is I imagine something that's elastic, like an elastic band or a rubber band. And in a rubber band, if you pull it, depending if something, so let's say this one is inelastic. So if you pull, you're not going to be able to pull it much. It's going to be fairly stiff. It's not going to stretch a lot. While if something is elastic, for a given amount of force, you're not able to pull it much. And if something is elastic, maybe for the same amount of force, you're going to be able to pull it a lot. So this right over here is elastic. And so the analogy maybe might make a little bit sense relative to price and demand. If something is elastic, so let me write this down, so let me write very elastic, if a given change in price, given price change, you have, and especially we'll talk about percentages in a little bit, but a given change in price, you have a large change in demand, so large percentage change. Let me just speak in terms of percentage. If you have a percentage change in P, you end up having a large percentage change in Q. That would be very elastic. So you could imagine the P is like the force, and the Q, the quantity demanded, is how far the thing can get stretched apart. And that's why we would call this very elastic, just like a very elastic rubber band. And if something is very inelastic, if given a percent change in P, you have a small percent change in Q. So just like a rubber band, for a given amount of force, if you're not able to pull it much at all, then it's inelastic. If you're able to pull it a lot, it's elastic. Same thing with price and quantity. For a given change in price, if the quantity demanded, if the percent quantity demanded changes a lot, very elastic. If it doesn't change a lot, very inelastic. Now, with that out of the way, let's actually calculate the elasticity for multiple points along this demand curve right over here. And I think that'll give us a better grounding, especially because there are a little slightly, I would call them unusual ways of calculating the percent change in quantity and the percent change of price, just so that we get the same number when we have a positive change in price and the same as we get the negative change in price, or a negative and a positive, or a drop in price and an increase in price. So let me give myself some real estate over here, because I want to do some actual mathematics. And actually, all of this we will be reviewing in what I'm about to do, and it'll give me some real estate to work with. So let me clear all of that, and let me clear that right over here. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to calculate the elasticity of demand at several points along this demand curve right over here. And so the first one I will do it at point A to point B. So let me make another column right over here. Elasticity of demand. And actually, we're going to have one column that's elasticity of demand. So it's a big E with a little subscript D. And the other one I'll just take its absolute value, because depending on, sometimes people like to just think of the number, which will tend to be a negative number, and sometimes people like to look at the absolute value of it. So we'll look at both and see what it actually means. So let's say our price drops from point A to point B. So from point A to point B, we have a negative $1 change in price, and we have a positive, so this is a negative $1 change in price, and we have a positive $2, sorry, a positive $2 burger per hour change in quantity demanded. So what is the elasticity of demand there? So let's write it over here. I'll do it in A's color. So the elasticity of demand, remember, it's the percent change in quantity. So percent change in quality, rewrite it. Percent change in quantity over percent change in price. And so we have, what's our percent change in quantity? So it's going to be the change in quantity over some base quantity. So our change in quantity is 2, so it's going to be equal to 2 over, now in traditional terms, and this is what I want to kind of clarify, it's a little bit unusual in how we do it, but we do it so that we get the same elasticity of demand whether we go from A to B or B to A, or essentially we get the same elasticity of demand along this whole part of the curve. Instead of just dividing the change in quantity divided by our starting point, what I want to do is I'm going to divide the change in quantity divided by the average of our starting and our ending points. So that's going to be 2 over, and I'll actually do the math explicitly. Actually, let's just think about it. What's the average between 2 and 4? Well, the average is just going to be 3. That's the average of 2 and 4. I could write, let me write it down just so it's clear. This right over here, that right over here, is 2 plus 4 over 2. That's how you get 3. That's how you would calculate the average. All right, so that is our proportionate change, and then you want to multiply by 100, times 100 to actually get a percentage. Then what is our change in price? We're going to do the same thing, or the percent change in price. Our change in price is negative 1. It is negative 1 over, and once again, we don't just do negative 1 divided by 9. We do it over the average of 8 and 9. The average of 8 and 9 is 8.5, and then multiply by 100 to get your percentage. Now, these hundreds obviously cancel out. We are going to be left with, when you divide by fractions, the same thing as multiplying by its inverse. We're going to get 2 thirds times negative 8.5 over 1, or times negative 8.5. Get out our calculator, and it is, so 2, well, multiply 2 times negative 8.5, and then divide it by 3, which gives us negative 5.6667. It's really negative 5 and 2 thirds. I'll just write it negative. I'll round it. It's negative 5.67. This is approximately equal to negative 5.67. Right over here, it's negative 5.67, and this absolute value is obviously just 5.67. I'll leave it to you to verify for yourself that you'll get the same elasticity of demand using this technique, where you use the average as your base in the percentage, going from 9 to 8 in price as going from 8 to 9 in price, which is different than if you use the 9 as the base or the 8 as the base. This right here is the elasticity of demand, not just at point A. You can view it as the average elasticity of demand over this little part of the curve, which is really a line in this example, over this part of the arc. We'll write that part right over here. I'll write the absolute value. The absolute value of our elasticity of demand is 5.67. Now let's do the other two sections right over here. Let's think about what happens when we go from C to D. Our elasticity of demand there. From C to D, we have a change in quantity, once again of plus 2, and our change in price, once again, is negative 1. We'll see, even though the change in quantity is the same and the change in price is the same, we're going to have a different elasticity of demand because we have different starting points. Our starting points and our ending points for price are lower and our starting and ending points for quantity are higher. It'll actually change the percentage. Let's see what we get. Our percent change in quantity, we have a change in quantity of 2, and then our average quantity is 9 plus 11, which is 20, divided by 2 is 10. All of that over percent change in price. We have negative 1. Let me scroll down a little bit. Negative 1 divided by the average price. Negative 1 is the change in price, and we want to divide that by the average price. 550 plus 450 is $10, divided by 2 is 5. The average price is 5. We can multiply the numerator by 100 and the denominator by 100, but that won't change anything because we can just divide both by 100. This is equal to 2 over 10, times, dividing by a fraction, same thing as multiplying by its inverse, times negative 5 over 1. This is just because 2 over 10 is the same thing as 1 fifth. 1 fifth times negative 5 over 1 is negative 1. This right over here, our elasticity of demand right over here is negative 1 or its absolute value is 1. The absolute value of the elasticity of demand right over here is equal to 1. Let's just do one more section, and maybe in the next video we can think a little bit about what it's telling us. Let's do this last section over here just for some practice. I encourage you to pause it and try it yourself. We're going to think about this section right over here. Once again, our change in quantity is plus 2, and our change in price is negative 1, and our elasticity of demand, change in quantity, 2 over average quantity, which is 17, change in price is negative 1, over average price, 1 plus 2 divided by 2 is $1.50, or $1.50 is right in between these two, divided by $1.50. We don't have to multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 because those just cancel out. We get 2 over 17 times negative, well, we could just write this as negative $1.50 over 1. This is equal to, getting our calculator back out, so this is equal to, I'll just write, well, it's really just going to be negative 3 over 17, right? 2 times negative 1.50 is negative 3 over 17, so negative 3 divided by 17 is equal to negative.18. Here it is negative 0.18, and its absolute value is 0.18. The elasticity of demand over here is 0.18. I'll leave you there, and in the next video, we'll think about these results a little bit."
2,2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6udRtn5jSWk,Perfect inelasticity and perfect elasticity of demand Microeconomics,"To get a better intuition for the price elasticity of demand, I thought I would take a look at some of the more extreme cases and think about what types of elasticities of demand we would see. So this right over here is a vial of insulin. Many diabetics, not all diabetics, but many diabetics need to take insulin daily. They need to inject it in order to maintain their blood sugar level. If they don't do it, bad things will happen to their body, and they might even prematurely die if they don't take their insulin on time. So let's think about what the elasticity of demand might look like for something like insulin. So in one column, I'll put price, and in the other column, I will put quantity. So let's say that insulin right now is going for $5 a vial. We have a group of diabetics who need insulin, and they're all going to buy the insulin they need. And let's say in this group, that turns out to be 100 vials per week. So this is in vials per week. Fair enough. That's exactly what they need to do to maintain their insulin. Now what happens if the price changes? What happens if the price were to go down? Let's say the price were to go down to $1. Well, what would the quantity be? Well, they're not going to buy any more insulin. They're going to buy just what they need in order to maintain their diabetes. And remember, we're holding all else equal. We're not assuming any change in expectations of price. They expect price to go up or down or anything like that. So in this case, they'll still just buy 100 vials. Now what happens if the price went up a ton? What if happens if the price went to $100 a vial? Well, it would be hard for them, but they need it to survive. So it's going to squeeze out any other expenses that they need to spend money on, and so they still will buy 100 vials a week. And so you could keep raising price within reason, and they would still buy the same quantity. Obviously, if you raise it to $1 billion, then they just wouldn't be able to afford it. But within reason, they're going to buy 100 vials per week, no matter what the price is. So this is an example of perfect inelasticity. Another way, so if you think of the physical analogy that we talked about with elasticity, it's like a brick. It doesn't matter how much within reason, once again, any amount of force pulling or pushing that a human could put on a brick, it's not going to deform the brick in any way. And likewise, any change in price within reason here isn't going to change the demand in any way. It's perfectly inelastic. And if you want to do the computation, you could figure out the demand elasticity for, let's say, when you're going from a price of $5 to $1. So the price went down by 4, and the quantity changed by 0. So your percent change in quantity, so delta percent change in quantity is equal to 0. And then your percent is going to be over your percent change in price. Your percent change in price, if you use the averaging method, it would be going down by 4 over an average of 250. It'll be a fairly large number, but it's 0 over anything is still going to be 0. So it doesn't matter what that thing is over here. Your elasticity of demand in this situation is 0. And if you wanted to see what this demand curve would look like, let's plot it. So this right over here is my price axis, and that is my quantity axis. And so no matter what, let's say this is a quantity of 100 vials per week. That's true when the price is $5. So that's true when the price is $5. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. That's true when the price is $1. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And that's true if the price is $20 or $100 or whatever. They're going to demand 100 vials a week. And so a perfectly inelastic demand curve would look like this. It is a vertical line. It doesn't matter what price you pick. The quantity demanded is always going to be the exact same thing. Now let's go to another extreme. So this is perfectly inelastic. You can imagine, well, what is perfectly elastic? Something that changes a lot if you have a small percentage change in price. And to think about that, let's look at these two vending machines. And you see that they both do sell cans of Coke. That's a can of Coke there. And that is a can of Coke there. And let's say starting off, the can of Coke, let's say that they cost $1 in each vending machine. They cost $1 in each vending machine. And we're going to assume that this one, remember, all else equals. So we're going to assume that this vending machine right over here doesn't change. Does not change. So it's just going to be consistently charging $1 for a can of Coke. And they're sitting next to each other. And it looks like they have a little coffee machine in between right over here. So let's think about the demand curve for Coca-Cola in this vending machine right over here. So let's think about the price and the quantity. Let me do price column and quantity demanded. So let's say if the price is $1, then just odds are it's going to get about half of the sales per week. And let's say that ends up being 100 cans. This is in cans per week. Now, what happens? And let me put some decimals here. So this is $1. The price is $1. It sells 100 cans per week. And probably this one would also sell about 100 cans per week. Now, what happens if we have a very, very small change in price? So if we go from $1 instead of $1, we are at $0.99. What's going to happen? So remember, this machine right over here is not changing. Our demand curve is for the quantity of Cokes sold from this machine. And the price we're talking about is for this machine. So if this machine is even a penny cheaper, and assuming that there aren't lines forming and things like that, people are just always going to go to this machine. If it's easy enough, if there's no difference between the two, they're always going to go to this machine. So this machine will sell all of the Cokes. So it's going to sell 200 Cokes. Now, what happens if instead of lowering the price by a penny, you raise the price by a penny? So instead of $1, you're at $1. Well, now everyone's going to go to the other vending machine. They're going to say, oh, we don't need even a penny. I might as well walk to this one, assuming everything else is equal. So then they're going to sell 0. And so what would the demand curve look like here? Well, let's plot it out. So this is the price. This axis right over here is quantity. And this is in cans per week. And so this is 0. This is 100. And then this is 200. And then this is a price of $1. That's $1. So at $1, the quantity demanded is 100 cans. Fair enough. Now, at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200 cans. So at $0.99, the quantity demanded is 200. So $0.99 is right below that. It's 200. So it's right over there. So it's like right there. It's a little bit lower. And at $1, a little bit over here, the quantity demanded is 0. So the demand curve here is going to look something like that. So it's going to be almost horizontal. So it's going to be approaching perfect elasticity. Very small changes in price end up with these huge changes in percent quantity demanded. And I encourage you to work out the math to see here that you will get a very large number for elasticity. And so something that is approaching perfect elasticity, a truly perfect elasticity would be something that is a horizontal line. So in this case, so over here, our elasticity of demand, and I'll talk about the absolute value of it, is 0. And over here, the absolute value of our elasticity of demand is infinity. Because remember, it's percent change in quantity over percent change in price. When you go from either from one scenario to another over here, your percent change in price is very small. It's roughly about 1% in this scenario right over here. Changing the price up or down about 1%. But then you see your quantity is changing, depending on which one you're looking. Your quantity is changing on the order of 50% to 100% from that 1% change in price. So you have a huge elasticity of demand here. It would actually be a number. But as you can imagine, as it becomes more and more sensitive, as quantity demanded becomes more and more sensitive to percent change in price, this curve is going to flatten out completely, and you will have an infinite absolute value of your elasticity of demand."
3,3,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXrOpjG4dUs,The business cycle Aggregate demand and aggregate supply Macroeconomics,"Let's make a plot of real GDP as a function of time. So this axis right over here is going to be real GDP. So it's an actual measure, not just nominal GDP. It's an actual measure of the goods and services produced by an economy or the productivity of an economy. And over here, let's have time. Now, in our little country or whatever economy we're studying here, let's assume that over time its population is growing. So let me write these things down. So population is growing over time. And this is not an unrealistic assumption. This is true of most countries. Population is growing over time. And also let's assume that productivity is improving. Productivity. And productivity is just essentially how much can each individual person produce. Productivity. Productivity is going up. And productivity goes up due to technology, in fact, probably mainly technology. Technology. Mainly technology, but there could be discoveries of resources. Discovery of resources. Or it could be new business processes. And people would even consider that maybe technology. So new processes. So on a per person basis, they're able to produce more and more over time. So because of these trends, and these are trends that do take place over long periods of time in many, many economies, you would expect the real productivity of that economy to increase. So if you were just to do the long-term trend just based on these two things, the population growing and productivity improving, over time real GDP should have a trend something like that. And that is the long-term trend of most properly functioning economies. But when you look at it on the short term, it doesn't look like a nice, smooth trend line like this. When you study any major economy in the world, or really any economy, any normal economy, instead of just going this nice, smooth trend line, it tends to look something more like this. Real GDP will be going really fast, maybe higher than the trend line, and then all of a sudden it will essentially recede, or it will essentially shrink, and then it will start growing again, maybe go above the trend line, then it will recede, go below the trend line, then go above the trend line, and it will just keep fluctuating around a trend line like that. And this fluctuation around this trend line is called the business cycle. This right over here, and you could maybe call one cycle, you could say it's from one peak to one peak, or one trough to one trough, or whatever you want to call it, it's this idea that the economy isn't just a nice, steady, steady as you go growth. You have periods of fast growth going above maybe the trend line, and then it recedes, then it expands, then it recedes. And so this is the business cycle. And the term cycle is a little bit misleading. Whenever you think of a cycle, and even the way I drew it, it kind of looks like a nice, well-defined pattern, and every the same amount of years you're going up and down. It kind of implies that it's predictable, but the reality is that the business cycle is very unpredictable, and economists, more than anyone, have trouble predicting the business cycle. So when you think of a cycle, it's not this nice sinusoid pattern. It's something much, much more unpredictable. So it does fluctuate up and down above a trend, but it's hard to predict. And in general, you don't have the same period of time between every peak and every trough, and that's why it is so hard to predict. And there are different terms for different phases of the business cycle, and I kind of used it just in describing what was happening. Over here, where the economy is growing, so the economy is growing from there to there, we would call this phase of the business cycle, so I'll highlight that in green, we would call that expansion because the economy is literally expanding. There's more goods and services being produced in that economy. And then when, and we'll talk about the reasons why this is happening, and then all of a sudden when it starts to shrink, the economy starts to shrink, this right over here, or you could call it recedes, if you think of it in kind of a title analogy, this right over here is called a recession. This right over here is a, so that purple part right over there is a recession. And if a recession is bad enough, it is sometimes categorized as a depression, and there's different categories for a depression. There's the famous joke, when your neighbor loses his job, it's a recession, when you lose your job, it is a depression. But the interesting thing is, is we see this pattern happening every, you know, whether it's every eight years, seven years, every ten years, but we don't fully understand exactly why it's happening. And what we're going to try to attempt to do in the next few videos is look at models that do attempt to explain it, and that's actually the whole purpose why we're going to study aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Now with that said, I want you to view those models with a huge grain of salt because those are, I would argue, overly simplified economic models that don't take into consideration probably the most important factor in the economic cycle or any type of market cycle, and that is human emotions. You might notice in most of our studies of economics so far, we haven't really talked a lot about human emotions or humans' tendencies to extrapolate the recent past or humans' greed or risk of fear and greed and all of these things that are very real things because in traditional economics, they don't fit neatly into the models. And there are new fields in behavioral economics and behavioral finance that do try to take into account things like human emotions, but it's not going to make its way into the models that we're going to study in aggregate supply and aggregate demand. And the reason why I say human emotions is because that, you know, just based on, I spent, I think it was six or seven years in markets while I was an analyst at an investment firm, it was very clear to me that what drove market cycles and economic cycles to a large degree was based on human emotions, that what you have happening over here is that the longer time, and this is, once again, this isn't kind of what you would classically learn in your freshman economics class. I'm just going to say this before we start studying the classical one because I think this does give a better sense of what's probably happening in an economic cycle. Right over here when the expansion phase is starting, people are still skeptical. They've just been through this, you know, people were getting laid off over here, people were losing their jobs, people were having trouble paying the bills, companies had very low profits or maybe no profits at all, bankruptcies were occurring. So even though the economy is starting to expand right over here, people are kind of skeptical. In the recent past, they remember all of this pain, so they don't want to go out there and start spending money, they don't want to go out there and start investing. But the further and further they go from that point, and so I'm just going to explain kind of the emotional aspect of the economic cycle, which I think is probably the most powerful one, the further and further they go away from this, they say, hey, maybe this is for real, maybe this is really happening. And their memories of that pain are more and more distant. Their memories of all the risk, the memories of all the layoffs and the bankruptcies become more and more distant, and then they become more and more confident and more and more eager to invest. And so they start investing and spending more and more, they start hiring, and because of all of that, they see fewer and fewer bankruptcies, fewer and fewer layoffs, hiring is starting to occur, people get more and more and more optimistic, and so the economy keeps growing. And when you go to points right around here, it's been a long time since anyone really talked about major layoffs and bankruptcies and foreclosures and all the rest, and so people over here are feeling super, super confident, and they're probably underplaying risk at this point, and they're investing money, they're spending money like there's no tomorrow because they think there will always be good growth, they're essentially extrapolating the recent past. And so they think, and there's actually even been studies that show that even economists, when you ask them at this point, what's the foreseeable future going to look like, they tend to extrapolate the recent past. They say the recent past we were growing like that, so in the future we will grow like that. But at this point, essentially people are being too bullish, they're being too optimistic, and they're probably misallocating investment, and then as soon as things don't grow as people expect, they start getting a little bit fearful, but they're still in denial at this point, they get a little bit more fearful, but here they say, oh my God, something is going on, they start panicking, layoffs start happening, economy recedes, and then we have the entire cycle again. And to kind of understand this emotional aspect of it, this is something I redrew a graph that always gets kind of chain-mailed around or sent around during the, usually during every bubble when people start becoming skeptical of the growth in economy. It traditionally refers to stock market cycles, but stock market cycles are closely linked to actual economic cycles, and I think these words really do capture the emotional sentiment of what's going on in either during the business cycle or during a stock market cycle. Is that right? When we're in the middle of an expansion, people are feeling pretty optimistic. A little bit further into it, people are feeling excitement. They're saying, hey, maybe this is kind of a new type of thing, maybe we're going to be able to grow forever. People are thrilled. People just the last few years, all they do is they remember making money. They say, well, I'm going to put all my money in the stock market and I'm going to start buying pets.com and whatever else. And then there's euphoria. They're like, wow, easy money. I don't have to work for a living. I can just keep flipping houses or buying stocks of pets.com or whatever else, day trading. And then all of a sudden you have some signs that maybe there was some bad investment, that people's investments weren't turning out as good as they expected. People get a little anxious, but then as you still perceive this, they start denying it. Some people say, are we in a recession? No, no, no, we're not in a recession. It's been so long since we were in a recession. Things are different this time. The internet changes everything. Housing never goes down. But then as it continues, as the recession really does continue, they start to get fearful. They start to say, wait, maybe this is something going on. Then desperate, then panic, and that's when people really, if you think of a stock market cycle, really start to sell. In the case of a regular business cycle, they start to maybe underspend. They start to really hoard things. Then capitulation, this is when they say, okay, things are just bad. They're never going to get any better, and then they become despondent. And eventually, you could really say emotionally, people start getting depressed because they say, wow, it's been so long since we felt all of these good emotions right over here. And as many good investors will tell you, this is the best time to invest. This is the worst time to invest. But then there's been so long, even though there's maybe a little bit of growth right over here, it's been so long since we experienced all of these emotions. People are depressed. But then as the growth continues, they start to feel hopeful, a little relieved. They say, hey, at least we're not getting worse and worse, and then you get back to optimism again. So keep this in mind because in my mind, the emotions really are the main factor that are playing in either stock market cycles or economic cycles. But when we study it kind of classically in an economics class, we're going to take human emotions a bit out of the picture, which is a little bit artificial because they might be the most important part of the picture."
4,4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPkh8kOldU4,Keynesian economics Aggregate demand and aggregate supply Macroeconomics,"What I want to do in this video is start introducing, and we've already talked about them a little bit, so actually they've already been introduced, but maybe flesh out a little bit more Keynesian thinking. So this right here is a picture of John Maynard Keynes, and I often mispronounce him as Keens because that's how it's spelled, but it's John Maynard Keynes. And he was an economist who did a lot of his most famous work during the Great Depression, because in his view, classical models did not seem to be of much use during the Great Depression. And so to understand this a little bit better, let's compare kind of purely classical aggregate supply, aggregate demand models to maybe more one that's more Keynesian. And some of what we've talked about, or Keynesian I should say, I already did my first mispronunciation, one that's a little bit more Keynesian, Keynesian right over here. And in some of the conversations, we've already begun to introduce a little bit of Keynesian thinking, but in this video, we're gonna try to show the difference between the two. And it's not to say that one is right or one is wrong. In fact, Keynesian felt that in the long run, the classical model actually made sense, but he also famously said, in the long run, we are all dead. And I also wanna emphasize that this isn't a defense of Keynesian economics, that there are some points to what he has to say, but there are other schools of thought. Unfortunately, they often get very dogmatic, but they also have some reasons to be wary of Keynesian economics, and we hope to go over some of that in future videos. But in this one, we just wanna understand what Keynesian economics is all about and how it really was a fundamental departure from classical economics. So in classical economics, so I'm gonna use aggregate demand and aggregate supply in both. So this is classical, this is price, this right over here is real GDP. Real GDP, and I'm gonna do it for the Keynesian case as well. So this is price, and this right over here is real GDP. Real GDP. Now in both views of reality or both models, you have a downward-sloping aggregate demand curve for all the reasons that we've talked about in multiple videos. That's aggregate demand, that is aggregate demand right over there. Now, and we've already seen it, the classical view is in that in the long run, in the long run, an economy's productivity or productive capacity or its output shouldn't be dependent on prices. So we've seen the long-run aggregate supply curve, something like this. This is the aggregate supply in the long run, or sometimes it's L, you'll have long-run aggregate supply. Sometimes it'll be referred to that. And saying, look, all prices are, they're a way to signal what people want and demand and things like that, but at the end of the day, prices and money, they're just facilitating transactions. And you go to work and you get paid and all that, but then you go and use that money to go buy other things that the economy produces, like food and shelter and transportation. So all money is is a way of facilitating the transactions, but the economy in theory, based on how many people it has, what kind of technology it has, what its productive, what kind of factories it has, what kind of natural resources it has, it's just going to produce what it's going to produce. And if you were to just change aggregate demand, if the government, let's say, were to print money and aggregate demand were to, and just distribute it from helicopters, in this classical model, you would just have aggregate demand shift to the right, but you have this vertical, long run, aggregate supply curve, so the net effect is it didn't change the output in this classical model. All that happens is that the price goes from this equilibrium price to this equilibrium price over here. So you have the price would go up and you would just experience inflation with no increased output. And there's multiple ways you could have shifted that aggregate demand curve to the right. You could have a fiscal policy where the government, maybe it holds its tax revenue constant, but it increases spending or it goes the other way around. It does not decrease, it doesn't change its spending, but it lowers tax revenue. Either of those, it kind of tries to pump money into the economy and pushes that aggregate demand curve to the right. And in this purely classical view, it says in the long run, that's not going to be any good, just will lead to inflation. The only way that you can increase the output of economy is by making it more productive. Maybe making some investments in technology, make the economy more efficient, maybe your population grows. So the only way is to really shift this curve to the right, on the supply side, on the supply side right over here. And Keynes did not disagree with that. But he's sitting here in the middle of the Great Depression and saying, look, all of a sudden people are poor in the 1930s, factories did not get blown up, people didn't disappear. In fact, there are factories that want to be run, but they're being shuttered down because no one is demanding goods from them. There are people that want to work, but no one is asking them to work. They could work and produce the wealth that could then be distributed to society, but no one's demanding for them to do it. So he suspected, well, something weird was happening with aggregate demand, especially in the short run. So in a very pure, very, very, very short run model, I know we have talked about kind of a short run aggregate supply curve that is upward sloping, so something that might look something like that. And that is actually starting to put some of the Keynesian ideas into practice. And what I like to think of it as kind of something in between. But if you think in the very, very, very, very short term, Keynes would say, well, prices are gonna be very sticky. So especially, especially, so in the short run, in the short run, and I'll call it the very short run, the very short run, you have, especially, especially if the economy is producing well below its capacity, like it seemed to be doing during the Great Depression, prices are sticky. Prices are sticky. And that makes intuitive sense. If the economy is starting to get overheated, people are being overworked, you want them to work more, hey, I want overtime. You want factories to operate faster, people are gonna start, and the utilization is high, people are gonna start charging in more and more. But if I'm unemployed and I'm desperate to work, I'm not gonna ask for a pay raise. If my factory is at 30% utilization and someone wants to buy a little bit more, that's not the time that I'm gonna say, hey, I'm gonna raise prices on you. I'll say, yeah, at the exact same price, yeah, you want another 5% of my factory to be utilized? Sure, that sounds great. So in the very short run, it kinda has the opposite view of the aggregate supply curve than the classical model. It says, it says at any level of GDP in the short run, prices won't be affected. It won't be affected. And so in this model right over here, so this is aggregate supply, and I'll call it the very short run. Very short run. And you can debate what short run or very short run means, whether we're talking about days, weeks, months, or even a few years here. But once you start looking at the world this way, then something interesting happens. In this model right over here, the only way to increase GDP was on the supply side. In this model right over here, the only way to increase GDP is on the demand side. To actually, either through monetary policy, print more money, or through fiscal policy. Lower taxes while holding spending constant, or maybe do both. You essentially deficit spending. Some way without maybe holding taxes constant, but the government spending more, whatever. Shift the curve to the right, and that might be a way, that might be a way to increase, to increase the overall output. And Keynes' real realization was, was that look, the classical economists would tell you if you have a free and unfettered market, the economy will just get to its natural, very efficient state. And Keynes says, yes, that is sometimes true, but that's sometimes not true. And we'll talk about different cases. And by no means do I think the Keynesian model is the ideal. I don't think even Keynes would have thought the Keynesian model describes everything. Depends on the circumstance. But Keynes would say, look, let's think of a very simple, a very simple idea. Let's say you have A, person A, person B, person C, and person D. And let's say person A sells to person B, person B sells to person C, person C sells to person D, and person D sells to person A. And let's say that they're all selling two units of whatever good and service that they offer. And for whatever reason, let's say C is getting a little bit, C is just all of a sudden got a little bit pessimistic, had a bad dream, woke up on the wrong side of the bed, and says, you know what, I'm not feeling so good about the economy. I'm gonna hold off for my purchase from B. Instead of two units, I'm going to purchase one unit. Well, B is, well, gee, my business is bad now. I'm only going to purchase one unit. And A does the same thing for the same reason. D does the same thing. Well, now it all came back to C, and now C is, wow, I was right. That dream was predictive. But it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. And now they're going to operate in this state. And there might not be any natural way to get them bumped up to that state where they were all buying two units from each other without maybe some outside, especially some government actor, maybe all of a sudden saying, hey, B, okay, if C doesn't wanna buy two, I'm gonna buy two temporarily. And there are dangers to this, huge dangers, and we'll talk about them in future videos. But then someone else, let's say the government, tries to shift the aggregate demand curve through fiscal policy and they say, hey, well, I'll buy one from you. I'll buy one from you, B. And so then B says, okay, now I can buy two again, and A can buy two again, and then D can buy two again, and then C can buy two again. And in an ideal world, and this is the danger of the government, the government would step back and say, okay, everything is fine again. I don't have to buy this. But as we know, it's very hard once the government starts spending money in some way to actually cut this spending right over here. But this was the general idea behind the Keynesian versus the classical. He says, look, there are circumstances like the Great Depression where the economy is operating well below its potential, and in those circumstances, you need to have a stimulus on the demand side, not just the supply side. Now, the correct answer is, with all things, is probably something in between. A probably a more accurate model is something like this. So let's draw, so this is price, this is real GDP right over here, and we'll still draw our downward-sloping aggregate demand curve, aggregate demand curve, and the more accurate thing might look something like this. Let's say that this is the absolute theoretical maximum output. If everyone in the country isn't sleeping, the factories are just being run to the ground, that's the absolute theoretical output. And let's say that this is its potential, just a healthy state where the economy might be operating. The real kind of medium-run supply curve or short-run supply, aggregate supply curve, so this is aggregate supply in the very long run, so this is in the long run, aggregate supply, the best model would be something that's in between. It might look something like this. So our aggregate supply curve might look something like, I want a different color, let me do it in magenta. So it might look something like this. Might look something like this. So for whatever reason, maybe someone has a bad dream or a bunch of people have a bad dream or something scary happens, aggregate demand, gets into stock market crashes, something happens, aggregate demand shifts over there. So when we're out here, now all of a sudden, our output is well below potential, we have a lot of excess capacity, and now the Keynesian ideas seem, maybe they'll make sense, maybe there should be some outside stimulus happening. Now on the other side, if we're performing well at potential, and then all of a sudden, the government wants to do Keynesian policies, and we'll see in future videos, the government will always wanna do Keynesian policies, even if they're not justified, it might do, it will push aggregate demand out here, and then the net effect is, especially the more vertical this is, the more this net effect will be true, that you really just get more inflation and you don't really get a lot of increase in output. So it really depends on the circumstance. But an aggregate supply curve that starts flat at low levels of output and then becomes, it gets higher and higher slope and becomes almost vertical near high levels of output, this is probably a better model that takes into consideration both the classical and the Keynesian ideas."
