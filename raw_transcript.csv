Jennifer Tejada, PagerDuty's chairperson and chief executive officer, and Howard Wilson, PagerDuty's chief financial officer. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that statements made on this call include forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it, which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include our growth prospects and future revenue, among others, and represent our management's belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update these. During today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are in addition to and not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release. For further information on these and other factors that could cause the company's financial results to differ materially are included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recently filed Form 10-K and 10-Q, as well as our subsequent filings made with the SEC. With that, I will turn the call over to Jennifer. Thanks, Tony, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We delivered a solid fourth quarter and another strong year in FY23. We are demonstrating durable and now profitable growth through significant product innovation and disciplined go-to-market execution. Revenue grew 32% year-over-year, and we added 379 net new customers to our platform during FY23. We achieved non-GAAP profitability one year ahead of plan, with an operating margin of 1% up 900 basis points over FY22. For Q4, we exceeded the high end of both our top and bottom line guidance ranges. Our Q4 revenue was $101 million, up 29% over the previous year, and our first quarter saw us surpassing the $100 million revenue milestone. We also surpassed $400 million in annual recurring revenue through a combination of ongoing product leadership in digital operations and our multiyear focus on winning in enterprise and mid-market. We ended the year with 68 of the Fortune 100 and nearly half of the Fortune 500 relying on PagerDuty to modernize their operations, where we continue to see significant expansion opportunities. Dollar-based net retention was 120%, our ninth consecutive quarter at or above that level. We exited Q4 with 752 customers contributing more than $100,000 in ARR, up 27% year-over-year. We continue to see high engagement from our customers, with a record number of mid-market and enterprise transactions in the quarter. Our top operating margin was 6% as a result of accelerating strategic initiatives to sustainably improve our cost structure. While we executed well in an increasingly difficult macroeconomic climate, we saw customers exercising more diligence and adding approval levels for medium to large deals. This has resulted in sales cycles elongating each of the past three quarters and transaction sizes decreasing. While annualized churn remained well below 5% of starting ARR, we experienced elevated levels of churn from small and medium-sized customers in Q4. In some cases, customers acquired seats in line with but not ahead of current needs. From a new customer acquisition perspective, tighter budget management and more restrictive buying authority added increased friction to landing new accounts, particularly in SMB. We've adapted to these dynamics in two principal ways. First, we have sustainably improved our cost structure to scale more efficiently and profitably, while investing in platform differentiation that widens the competitive gap. Second, we are successfully engaging customers with a comprehensive operations cloud value proposition to help them optimize their operating efficiency and to streamline their technology ecosystems. As a result, platform opportunities now make up a higher mix of our total pipeline than a year ago. Our product development teams increased our new product velocity meaningfully in FY23, with several newly available products released that position PagerDuty for further expansion across enterprise customers. Some of our major new releases that leverage AI or automation include incident workflows, event orchestration for AIOps, automation actions, and status pages, as well as a comprehensive customer service offering. We continue to expand our ecosystem with over 700 integrations. Earlier this year, we made incident workflows generally available to PagerDuty customers. This unlocks flexibility for our customers, leveraging technology from our acquisition of Catalytic using no code workflows, so teams can rapidly customize for specific business, team, and operational needs. Incident workflows automate work, minimize human error, and empower our customers to immediately capture tangible ROI across a wider range of operational needs. We also launched PagerDuty status pages during the quarter, enabling users to securely communicate real-time operational updates directly from the platform to end customers, as well as to key stakeholders across the business. Status pages leverage both event orchestration and incident workflows to create a single source of the truth and automatically post detailed updates, saving time during an incident response. Unlike other status page solutions, PagerDuty eliminates the need for multiple tools, reducing costs. Many PagerDuty customers have added status pages to their accounts and replaced less integrated and less automated point solutions. In February, we released the Customer Service Operations application for ServiceNow Customer Service Management. Building on a popular integration, the application enables seamless collaboration between customer service agents and engineering teams. PagerDuty customers can drive trials of this new application inside the platform, leading to efficient product discovery and reduced friction for expansions. In addition, we delivered many platform-wide initiatives, which continue to improve the reliability and security of our platform and made progress on the path to FedRAMP certification. All new launches are tightly integrated, creating compounding value for PagerDuty customers with comprehensive deployments. Looking ahead to our FY24 platform roadmap, we expect to continue investing in a high rate of innovation across the operations cloud. We will build on our workflow automation, expand our AIOps offering, further enable distributed process automation, and add additional flexibility to design workflows for customer service teams and other business operations use cases. I want to thank our product and engineering teams for one of our most productive, innovative years to date. Our go-to-market teams also executed well, despite a tougher demand environment evolving as the year progressed. During the year, we launched PagerDuty Japan, standardized our global go-to-market model, and advanced our product partnership with AWS. Our TAM remains expansive, and our go-to-market teams are realizing economies of scale. Customers remained very engaged throughout the year, and we closed a record number of customer transactions in both Q3 and Q4. ARR per customer continues to grow, which has been a consistent trend, up 23% for the year. We continue to see enterprise customers in highly regulated industries derive significant efficiency from the operations cloud, maintaining security and compliance even as they reduce incident duration, volume, and noise while increasing their productivity. This quarter, a global 500 North American consumer bank signed a six-figure expansion, including our largest customer service operations deal of FY23. The customer also added process automation and expanded their incident response deployment. They now invest over $1 million in annual recurring revenue with PagerDuty and are actively evaluating our AIOps solution. By partnering closely with the CTO, we aligned on priority operational outcomes for the year. PagerDuty has become the bank's strategic partner for modernizing their operations. We conservatively anticipate an initial ROI of over 300% with a payback period of as little as three months. A leading provider of cloud-based enterprise software for payroll, human resources, and financial management has been a PagerDuty customer since 2015. In the fourth quarter, they signed a seven-figure, three-year expansion agreement. They now pair PagerDuty's incident response with automation actions, process automation, and customer service operations. They utilize the PagerDuty operations cloud to manage major incidents across their global business, minimize impact to customers, and maximize operational efficiency with automation. In Q4, we closed a six-figure expansion with a European-based food delivery marketplace. The company has been a PagerDuty customer since 2013, but had previously been utilizing multiple solutions in addition to PagerDuty. Last year, in an effort to standardize IT solutions globally and reduce their infrastructure costs, they decided to standardize on PagerDuty. In addition to retiring point solutions, they are adopting our operations cloud platform. Our first value is champion the customer, putting our users at the center of our innovation, building great products, and making things easy. Part of championing our customers means building an equitable company that reflects the global and diverse users, customers, and communities we serve. In FY23, we advanced the efforts of PagerDuty.org by launching both our climate equity portfolio and the PagerDuty impact accelerator to deliver product, volunteer, and financial support to mission-driven organizations. We also continue to build on our inclusion, diversity, and equity programming. In Q4, we released PagerDuty's third annual ID&E report, tracking our progress and sharing our path forward. In FY23, we increased the number of underrepresented people and women in our senior leadership, including technical leadership. We achieved gender pay equity worldwide and are within a single cent between majority employees and underrepresented groups in comparable roles. These improvements are both the result of systematic focus and an expression of deeply held values across the PagerDuty team. While we are proud of our progress, we acknowledge we have more work to do. I encourage you to read the full report on the website. Organizations of all types need to modernize their operations in the face of rapid digitization. The cost of interrupt work and disruption has never been higher. Ticketing and queued solutions fail to address the complex nature of modern digital operations. Our customers continue to demonstrate their need for greater efficiency and faster paths to value, choosing PagerDuty as their long-term strategic partner and the operations cloud as their platform for engagement. While macroeconomic conditions continue to evolve in the near term, our long-term tailwinds, digital acceleration, DevOps transformation, and cloud adoption continue to be multi-year imperatives for our customers. We are confident in our long-term opportunity and as such, will continue to invest behind our strategic priorities while improving our operating margins. We are still early in a large market and we remain focused on building a durable and profitable growth company. Our innovation has strengthened our competitive advantages and brought several new products to market that we have begun to monetize. Our high levels of customer loyalty are validated by our net retention and continued growth of customers spending more than $100,000 annually. Loyalty is the platform businesses rely on to produce seamless digital experiences, maintain their digital infrastructure, and free capacity to focus on innovation. I'm inspired by our customers, energized by our teams, and confident in both our ability to navigate near-term challenges and to execute on the long-term opportunity ahead of us. Thank you to our team, to our customers, and to our partners for your dedication, your work, and your loyalty. With that, I'll turn the call to Howard and I look forward to your questions. Thank you, Jen, and good day to everyone joining us on this afternoon's call. Our fourth quarter and fiscal year results demonstrate durable, profitable growth driven by customers continuing to rely on the PagerDuty Operations Cloud to reduce costs, protect revenue, and retain talent. In what continues to be a tough macroeconomic environment, we noted strong retention and a high volume of customer transactions. And as a company, we continue to make progress on our profitability goals, being profitable on a non-gap basis for the full year. Unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-gap basis and are reconciled to our gap results in the earnings release that was posted before the call. Revenue was $101 million in the fourth quarter, up 29% year over year. The contribution from international was 24% of total revenues and unchanged from Q4 of last year. We delivered dollar-based net retention in Q4 of 120% compared to 124% in the same period one year ago. DBNR has been at or above 120% for nine consecutive quarters. However, based on customer data from the second half of FY23, we are modeling a range of 117 to 120% in FY24, with Q1 being at the low end of the range. Customers spending over $100,000 annual recurring revenue grew to 752, up 27% from a year ago. Total paid customers increased by 3% annually to 15,244 compared to 14,865 in the year ago period. Consistent with the macro, in the small-medium business segment, we had slower acquisition and elevated levels of churn, which slowed total paid customer growth. Free and paid companies on our platform grew to over 24,000, an increase of approximately 120% compared to Q4 of last year. With over 80% of our ARR coming from the enterprise and mid-market segment, we will continue our focus on paid customer acquisition in these segments and leverage our free offering in SMB. As a result, we expect total paid customer growth to be in a range of 5% to 10% in FY24. In terms of metrics that we provide on an annual basis, customers with ARR over $1 million increased to 50, up 16% compared to Q4 of last year. ARR from customers using two or more paid products was 58%, one point lower than FY22, and up from 49% in FY21 and 29% in FY20. Please note that the numbers shared on this call were derived at the customer level, which is consistent with our paid customer calculation. On last year's fourth quarter call, we presented numbers at the account level. And we exited Q4 with $410 million in annual recurring revenue, which was an increase of 26% year over year. Q4 gross margin of 86% remained within our target range of 84% to 86%. Marketing income improved to $6 million or 6% of revenue compared to a loss of $2 million or 3% of revenue in the same quarter last year. The annual improvement was driven by sustainable sales and marketing efficiency gains and economies of scale across GNA. And the quarterly improvement was as a result of our long-term operations efficiency initiatives. In terms of cash flow for the quarter, cash from operations was $18 million and free cash flow was $16 million. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $371 million, up 32% year over year, and a similar growth rate as FY22. Gross margin was 85%, relatively flat year over year. Marketing income was $3 million or 1% of revenue compared to a loss of $23 million or 8% of revenue a year ago. Operating cash flow was $17 million compared to negative $6 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $9 million compared to negative $13 million in fiscal 2022. And headcount increased to 1,166, up 23% year over year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $477 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total deferred revenue ended the quarter at $209 million, up 23% year over year. Quarterly calculated billings were $130 million, which was an increase of 23% year over year, standing above the guidance of approximately 20% provided during last quarter's call. This result includes approximately $3 million in prepaid multi-year billings. Adjusting for this, the increase was 21% and also above the guidance. We expect billings growth for Q1 to be approximately 20%. Given quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in billings, we focus on trading 12-months billings. On a trading 12-months basis, billings were $410 million, an increase of 27% compared to a year ago and above the rate provided during our last call. As a reminder, the comparable period Q4 of FY22 included a one-time benefit of approximately $2 million from early renewals. We expect trading 12-months billings growth exiting the first quarter to be approximately 24%. In providing guidance, we are factored in the current macroeconomic environment, which from a top-line perspective manifests itself in longer sales cycles on larger deals and increasing volume of smaller purchases, general conservatism in spending, particularly for new projects, and increased challenge for small and medium businesses. For the first quarter fiscal 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $102 to $104 million, representing a growth rate of 19 to 22%, and net income per diluted share attributable to PagerDuty Inc. in the range of 9 to 10 cents, with fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately $104 million. This implies an operating margin in the range of 6 to 7%. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $446 to $452 million, representing a growth rate of 20 to 22%, and net income per diluted share attributable to PagerDuty Inc. of 45 to 50 cents, with fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately $105 million. This implies an operating margin of 8 to 9%. Before moving to questions, I would like to provide assistance with modeling FY24. We expect non-gap gross margin to be in our target range between 84 and 86%. Q1 cash outflows include a one-time severance payment of $5 million and seasonal payments related to our short-term incentive plan, and for Q2, interest on our convertible debt. Q2 expenses will include the first full quarter of annual merit increases. With respect to free cash flow, the second half is expected to be higher in terms of free cash flow margins. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow margin to be at least a couple of points better than our operating margin. In what has been an uncertain economic environment, I would like to thank our customers for their continued partnership, our expanding operations cloud offerings that help our customers transform critical work, our high retention rates, and demonstrated operational efficiency put us in a strong position this year to continue with revenue growth above 20% and expand our operating margins significantly. With that, I will open up the call for Q&A. Okay thank you team, and we do have hands raised for questions already. Let me bring Jennifer on with us. And we'll turn first to Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a solid end to the year and on the outlook. Very impressive on the margin guide. I'm happy to see that as well. When you look at the full year outlook, Howard, and given that you saw elevated churn on the S&B, and remind me, I think it was about, it was around 20% of ARR. How much of that churn is a headwind going into next year when we look at the full year guide? Thanks, Sanjit. So you're right, so S&B represents about 20% of our revenues. We have contemplated that and factored that into the guidance that we've given for this year. So we've modeled in similar levels of movement within S&B, both in terms of new customer acquisition and downgrade in churn. Makes sense. And then just one more question on sort of the outlook, because I was really happy to see the 20% plus revenue growth. And that's on the question of layoffs. And we continue to see big tech announce pretty sizable layoffs. What's the sort of update on the assessment there? Are engineers still finding jobs relatively quickly in terms of, and then potentially coming back to pay-duty if they leave the company and go on to the next one? Yeah, I'll take that question. Nice to see you, Sanjit. Look, we're very confident in our top and bottom line guide. We've given a lot of thought to the macro, and while we have seen layoffs, what I would say is we continue to see most of those layoffs outside of engineering. And if anything, what we're finding is the incident response has become more important, because our customers are looking to help their engineers do more with less, improve their productivity, and in fact, decrease the cost of their infrastructure. So we're right platform at the right moment in this current market environment. And no question has it been a tough environment that's had some impact, but our team's executing very well and executed through the pandemic very well. So we have a high degree of confidence that we can deliver on our guidance, you know, even if this macro environment persists. And if it were to improve, we would see that as upside. Great. Thank you so much for the thoughts. And congrats on the outlook. Thank you. Thanks, Sanjit. Thanks. And with that, I will turn to Matt Hedberg with RBC. Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Congrats for me on the results, and especially the free cash flow guide, Howard. I think that's really, really excellent. Jen, I want to start with you from a high-level perspective. There's been a lot of talk, obviously, about generative AI, and you guys have had a longstanding focus on AI in general. Can you give us your perspective on, you know, what generative AI might mean for the PagerDuty platform going forward? Well, for sure, AI has been a mainstay alongside of automation in every part of our platform, and it's an area that we continue to invest in. I think one of the places where we were early was in building a foundational data model to support our customers in moving from simply responding faster to issues as they arise to actually proactively preventing those issues from becoming major customer impacts. And that has been through leveraging AI in incident response, in AI ops, in parts of our automation product, and increasingly in customer service. You know, generative AI, right now we see it used for a lot of content creation. It's dependent on a large model, you know, the internet being one of those. But one of the challenges for generative AI in our space is our customers expect a very high level of fidelity in the signals that they get. False positives or false negatives are not good things when you're dealing with business critical or mission critical infrastructure. And so I think that it's going to take some time to determine where the right role for generative AI is in the product per se. But you can imagine shortening efforts in diagnostics, reducing the time that it takes to know which service is a root cause or how to remediate, et cetera. And we're experimenting with some of those things. But from an analytical AI perspective, I still think the data set that we have puts us in a very good position to continue to use AI and machine learning across the platform to automate some of these big challenges when our customers are looking for productivity and efficiency above all else. Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then, Howard, for you, I appreciate all the color on the guidance. One question for me, could you remind us again what your exposure from a vertical perspective is to tech spending, maybe financial services these days? Yes. So, Matt, you know, we've increasingly become more diverse in terms of the industries that we cover. We do have a presence in software and technology and financial services, but also across media and entertainment, travel and hospitality, telecommunications. So that's a broad base, which helps us at least to be able to manage certain movements within those particular industries. That gives us, to some extent, a level of resilience. But we are able to prepare for that in terms of being able to focus on those different industries with their specific needs at a point in time. Yeah. And I'd make the point that in some of those verticals you mentioned, what we're seeing is increased appetite for automation and a platform that improves productivity, a real effort to look at infrastructure costs and try and remove duplicate costs where you might have point solutions that you could replace with the platform. And so our efforts in AIOps, in really leveraging AI in our incident response product, when that's now become more important as our customers are trying to protect revenues, protect customers and subscribers, is well-timed. Got it. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Matt. Turning next to Joel Fishbein at Truist. Thank you for taking my question and congrats also on a great execution. Jennifer, you've talked about on the call and gave us some good details on some of your big wins in the quarter. Probably from a go-to-market perspective, you're stressing the platform. And I think the environment that we're in right now is very ripe for vendor consolidation. And so I would love to understand what the cadence is on platform sales for you guys, maybe some of the go-to-market things that you're doing there. And then some of the, from a customer perspective, how pager duty is being viewed from a customer perspective versus how it was maybe 18 months ago. Yeah, I think in some ways our innovation outpaced our branding. And so really building out awareness around our new products and services associated with the broader operations cloud value proposition is something that Catherine Calvert, our new CMO, she's not really that new anymore, our CMO is very focused on. And I think what's important there is that when you leverage an integrated platform that combines incident response, AIOps, automation, along with customer service operations, you get benefit across those teams from every part of the platform. And you also get benefit from the integration of those solutions. So the incident response, flexible workflows, inform some of the signal that comes into event intelligence, which allows you to get out in front of some of these issues instead of just responding to them, preventing events from becoming major incidents. Building customer service ops enables customer teams to more effectively communicate and manage situations with their customers and likewise become part of the incident response process themselves by raising issues or providing input into the incident response. All of this is built in an easy to use sort of seamless platform environment where you don't have to be a dev to understand how to leverage pager duty. And I think that is a big step forward. Some of the other products and services that we built that may not be as obvious. One is the flexibility and the ability to be able to build low code or no code workflows opens us up to new use cases, not only within incident response, but enabling customers to work however they want to work, even if they're not a mature DevOps full service ownership shop, they can work the way they need to work. And likewise, teams in other parts of the business, whether it's customer service or sales and marketing, finance, et cetera, being able to leverage the product for what we call interrupt work. At the end of the day, it all comes down to helping our customers understand from a high level perspective that our platform is all about modernizing your operations and improving your productivity while at the same time ensuring a seamless digital experience for customers. And that in this current macro environment seems to be really well suited for where our customers are trying to go. More with less, less infrastructure spend, less duplication in terms of point solutions within the ecosystem, and yet better, faster innovation and service to their end customers. So again, kind of right platform at the right moment for the current environment that we're in. Great. And I could follow up, Howard. I'm sorry. I was just going to add to that. And the way that that's also showing up is that if we have a look at opportunities right now, platform opportunities are making up a much higher mix of our total pipeline than a year ago. So our sales team is really getting that message of selling the integrated story of when you're putting instant response, AI ops, automation, customer service ops together, you unlock a different level of power for the customer. And what does that do to deal sizes just generally? So there's two effects. The one is that it will in some cases make for larger deals, but because of the way our platform is constructed, customers are able to, you know, they could be an instant response customer and they can add automation, or they could be an automation customer and they could add instant response. So it opens up the opportunity to create a roadmap with the customer that they don't necessarily have to execute on all at once, but it gives them a pathway to how they can actually build and create an operations cloud within their environment. Thank you. Thanks, Joel. Excellent. Moving next to Chad Bennett from Cray Calum. Chad. Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So Howard, maybe just to drill down a little bit on net retention for the year in the 117 to 120 range that you gave. So how are you thinking about that in terms of CDX, the CDX-5, the CDX-6, the CDX-7, the CDX-8, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-8, the CDX-8, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-8, the CDX-9, the CDX-9, the CDX-8. Yeah. So, you know, CDX is still one of the primary drivers for us in terms of our growth, but But increasingly, we are seeing the adoption of other products within the platform as being a key element. And most notable in that is our AIOps solution, particularly with the strengthening of our offering around event orchestration is making that even more relevant to customers. And in terms of automation, the fact that we now have multiple LANs and different ways in which customers can use process automation means that it's much easier for us to, in fact, grow those customers with these additional offerings. And that's reflected in the average revenue per customer continuing to increase. Again, this quarter, as it has every quarter very consistently over the past few years, has continued to grow and in fact, it was up 23% at the end of Q4. So our customers are using more of page duty and that's showing up both in terms of users, but increasingly in terms of more of the use of the platform. Got it. And then maybe just in terms of what you indicated on free cash flow margins being, I think, a couple of hundred points, a couple of hundred basis points ahead of margin. So would that imply that that billing's growth for the year should exceed revenue growth or is there something else that's providing that delta there? Yeah, so just to be clear, that's for the full year that I'm saying it is because it will move, it will flex throughout the year as it does. I guess the way that, you know, we haven't provided specific guidance on billings for the full year. We've provided guidance for Q1. And you know, what I would always point people to is if you look at the trend, the way in which our billings tends to follow our revenue guide over time, you'd expect to see that similar mechanic play out through this next year. Okay. Thanks much for taking my questions. Thanks Chad. Thank you. Next moving over to Matt Stotler with William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Hey Jen, hey Howard. Good to see you both. Hey Matt. Good to see you too. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess maybe first on the partner ecosystem, I'd love to just get an update on, you know, partner contribution at this point, you know, how those relationships are playing out kind of on the broader timeline of ramping those up, but also considering the near-term macro. Obviously ServiceNow is relatively new. You know, mentioned AWS recently, but you've got a number of other, you know, pretty solid partners. So we'll have to get a broad update there. Sure. I mean, partners continue to be an important and emerging growth factor for us from a channels perspective. AWS from a product standpoint, excuse me, I'm going to cough. One second. Excuse me. AWS has really stepped up from a product standpoint with us and where we've seen a lot of benefit is through the marketplace where customers in a constrained budget environment are able to deploy AWS prepaid spend to retire pager duty licenses. So that has helped a lot of our customers continue to invest in productivity and automation to reduce their overall infrastructure footprint. Excuse me. I have something in my throat. Julia Fair, who's relatively new to the business, is looking at some interesting new partnerships from a regional perspective too, to augment the opportunity that we have in regions where we don't have feet on the street. I've seen some encouraging things recently in Japan where we closed a deal through a partner in Japan in the financial services sector. And that's a very new market for us, a market where having partners on the ground is really important. And so we're encouraged by that, but the vast majority of our ARR revenue still comes from our direct go to market organization and our product led growth model. I think some of the things that I'm really encouraged about are, you know, even through our direct sales force, who's really embracing the operations cloud and getting better and better at selling not just the vision, but the near term opportunity there. We've seen our largest customer cohort continue to expand with us. So customers spending over 100K grew 27% in the quarter. And not a single one of our customers is sold out. We still have a lot of TAM to go after within those customer bases, whether it's, within those customers, whether it's seat based or it is use case based or functional or product specific. I think in the future, partners could be helpful in helping our customers with the transformation. Like how are they driving the changes necessary to become more productive? You know, how are they improving their workflows and their processes? How are they leveraging pager duty to the full extent? So that's exciting, but, you know, something that still is out in front of us. Right. Yeah, that's helpful. And then the comment on Japan is a good segue into the second question here on just the international markets, right? Pretty consistent as a percentage of revenue. I would love to maybe just double click on what you're seeing there, both in Q4, obviously, you know, early in fiscal 24. And then as you think about what's embedded in guidance, you know, outside of North America, we'd love to get some color there as well. Sure, I can start, Howard, if there's anything you want to add, or if I choke to death, you can jump in. You know, we continue to see a lot of the same macro trends in particular in Europe, where, you know, we had seen sales cycles elongate, we had seen more approvals and more diligence on deals. But what's been pleasing is the ongoing engagement from customers and, you know, record number of transactions in the quarter, even though those transactions may be smaller than they have been in the past, it just shows that customers are still looking to partner with us long-term. And I think it sets us up in a really strong position when the market does recover at some point in time, you know, we're in a very good position with a competitive platform that is well-seated into those customers. So, continuing to see high engagement, had some really interesting wins, including the one we talked about in the food delivery space, a team that is executing very well, you know, given the conditions. And it's early days for Japan. I'm excited about that market. I think that will be an important market for PagerDuty and an important market more broadly for the cloud and for software. But, you know, all I guess to summarize, the economic environment has been pretty consistent in some cases. You know, it's gotten a little tougher, and yet all of our go-to-market teams are executing very well, given the environment. And I think they've really turned the corner on being able to pivot towards productivity, reducing infrastructure costs, helping customers become more efficient. And our customers have been signaling to us that incident response is more important, that PagerDuty is essential infrastructure, and they'd like to consolidate, you know, more and more of their spend away from point solutions onto our platform. Very helpful. Thank you. Okay. Next, we'll hear from Kingsley Crane. Kingsley, go ahead, with ConaCord. Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So look, I think you're solidly profitable. You're guiding almost double-digit operating margins. Has your approach to the long-term model evolved at all? Is 20 still the best long-term margin? You have such strong gross margin, 85, it seems like, you know, maybe that could become higher. Kingsley, I like the way you said we're solidly profitable, like we've been doing that for years. I really agree, because that was not easy. But Howard, I'll go ahead and let you answer. Yeah, yeah. So Kingsley, we haven't provided an update to our long-term model. So you'll see even in our most recent investor deck, we kept that, which has, you know, operating margin at scale at 20%. You know, right now, you know, that model, I think, is still valid. Right now, given the current macro, we're focusing particularly on what we see happening ahead of us within this next year, and have, you know, a high level of confidence in our ability to execute on the guide that we've given for this year. So keeping revenue growth above 20% and operating margin, you know, in that 89% for the full year. Okay, fair enough. And then, so for status page, the newly released product, is that price traditionally on users of the customer, or is that somehow based on the end user of the customer, so two layers of removal? And any sense of adoption expectations or impact on top line? Yeah, sure. So the pricey model net is different from our other models in that it's effectively based on the number of subscribers that a particular customer would contract for. And so the expectation is that those subscribers could be internal or external to the company. So it creates a, you know, effectively targets the end user of the status page notifications. This of course is a relatively new offering for us, but the, to date, the experience we've had, it's something that customers were asking us to do before. And hence, you know, I intend to move from what was primarily initially just an internal offering to a fully external offering. But what's even more important is the way in which we're using automation with our status pages in that it's not relying on some person, like a lot of traditional status pages, going into a separate environment to capture a message and publish that message. We in fact have it fully integrated into the incident response life cycle, and we're using automation and templates to be able to make it super easy to drive this level of communication that you typically want across a broad set of stakeholders. So good, good early signs, but this is something that's only recently been released. Okay. Thanks, Howard. Thanks, Jen. Really helpful. Thank you. Thank you. And next we will hear from Andrew Sherman. Go ahead from TD Cowan. Oh, great. Thanks. It's Andrew. I'm for Derek. Good to see you guys. Jen, the record number of transactions in both enterprise and commercial is impressive, especially these days. Is there anything reps are doing specifically to drive that velocity? How much of this is expansions versus net new logos? And once the macro does improve, does this give you greater visibility into future expansions? I think it's just a good reinforcement of how important our high velocity land and expand motion is. Our team refers to this as the healthy hustle, making sure that they don't let the customer drive the pace of the sales cycle, that we put ourselves in a position to enable customers to buy what they need when they need it and not drag out sales cycles by pushing too far ahead of the demand. And Jeremy, who is leading our go to market organization, who is someone, frankly, whose transition has gone really well from a go to market leadership perspective, is the person that really architected and mechanized this motion. And we have been able to push that high velocity transactional motion further and further up into larger market segments. And to your point, what that enables us to do is seed opportunities in customers faster, move away, let them grow organically, let them work through the deployment, let them see the value, and then come back to them to add on or to capture additional demand, whether it grows organically or because we learn something, see a new use case within the customer. So I think that has served us very well. And like I said, I think the go to market organizations also pivoted effectively to going from selling the premier technical solution to selling a solution where automation can truly improve productivity and efficiency in a moment when our customers really need it. So just really proud of the execution there. I think standardizing our go to market model has also helped. So every region is attacking this the same way. It frees up time and creates some streamlining in how our teams build pipeline. And the last thing that I would say is we've applied a lot more rigor around multi-product pipeline and multi-product selling. So really helping the Salesforce understand the importance of taking multiple products to market, but also being able to work through the narrative and understand the customer problems that we're solving with an integrated platform. I'd also say retention, you know, retention of reps is higher this year than it was last year and we're entering this year with more ramp capacity than we have in the past. So really in a strong position from a go to market perspective. That's great. Thanks, Jen. One for you, Howard, we'd love to hear a little bit on linearity in the quarter. How did that track and how are your pipeline indicators looking currently? Have you added any extra levels of scrutiny to those metrics? Any color there would be helpful. So if I look back at Q4, which feels like a lifetime ago right now, you know, Q4 was not an unusual quarter in terms of linearity, but what was different is that we would typically see an end of year flush of customers looking to release budget in some shape or form, and that did not happen this quarter. So it was a bit different. And I think that was just a reflection on the macro. Going into this year, you know, what we're seeing is the fact that we do have strength in terms of our pipeline now is increasingly more oriented around the platform sales. So customers acquiring more than one product or acquiring multiple products in order to deliver on this operations card. And as Jen mentioned, we've entered this quarter with more ramp reps than we've had ever before at the start of the year, which is a good place to be. So we're seeing good signals in terms of that within this environment, right? So I think in this environment, we're still seeing customers being cautious. We're seeing customers being careful about their spending, but certainly high levels of engagement and activity within the customer base. Excellent. Thank you. Thanks, Andrew. Thank you. A couple more questions coming in. Next, we'll go to Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob? Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Hey, Rob. Hey, Howard. Hi, Jen. Hi, Rob. Yeah, appreciate your time. A lot of great questions asked so far, but I'll have a couple just. So Jen, on the, you know, Howard, you had said there was no budget flush in the quarter. Nevertheless, you guys landed some really impressive deals year-end, some large lands and expansion. So I wanted to get a sense from you guys a little bit more about what went into some of those large deals, particularly on the expansion side. Obviously, you guys are talking a lot about platform here. I think up to 50% of AR are now multiple products. But at those largest customers, like the big lands you have, the 50 customers now paying you over a million dollars, where are you relative to, you know, automation, customer service? And I know you just mentioned Jeremy. That was one of my questions. Can you maybe talk about ways in which Jeremy is focused on, you know, getting those products now into the pockets and understood of the sales reps that are selling the largest enterprises? And then I have a quick follow-up. Sure. In Q4, we made a big push around enablement to get our sales force more comfortable being able to talk about both the problems and then how we apply solutions to issues like infrastructure automation or how to automate runbooks to support faster incident response or compress the time and the impact of an incident, how to think about engaging with customer service leaders in terms of the customer service operations conversation and increasingly getting comfortable about talking about AI in terms of event orchestration and really starting to understand the impact of dependent services and being able to orchestrate work more effectively, orchestrate event correlation more effectively. And so I think we made a lot of headway just purely from enablement perspective and helping our reps talk to our customers about this. Also, we put a lot of time and effort into business assessments, business value assessments that leverage customer data and customer information to give them a sense of where the productivity unlock lives. And then we go back around and assess whether or not we delivered upon that. And usually we underestimate and overdeliver in that regard. I've had customers, many of which have said, you know, one major incident paid for last year's pager duty subscription and then some just through closing, compressing the time frame and the blast radius of that incident. And so I think there's also the benefit that from a market perspective, as teams become more constrained, as budgets become more constrained, we have customers coming to us saying, help me to reduce my infrastructure costs, help me to unlock productivity. So we're sort of meeting that demand, I think, reasonably well prepared for it. And that's been super helpful. The last thing I would say is in most of the cases where we've described some of these larger deals, these are customers that have been with us since 2013, 2015, 2017. And I've always said that we're sort of a patient grower, that our customers often start where they are with a very basic use case. And then you see those businesses become more digital or you see the digitization of their business model take place, and they require more partnership, more support. We've also seen the rise of more technical leadership at a lot of these companies. And technical leaders tend to really understand the value of automating incident response, the value of automation more broadly. And culturally, we're seeing a greater acceptance around leveraging AI to make decisions that, you know, historically people made in a swivel chair, talking to each other in an operation center. So all of those trends are kind of coming together for us. Great. Thanks, Jen. Appreciate it. Howard, you guys are one of a very short list of our coverage companies that was able to put through a price increase last year. I think you guys are anniversarying that, if I'm not mistaken, what the first half or maybe this coming quarter. Just anything to call out for us there? It sounds like it's gone well, you know, in aggregate. And how's the right way to think about it? Is it just straight up, here's your price increase, or is this also an opportunity, giving you guys an opportunity to talk about the platform and greater value that PagerDuty can deliver? Thanks, guys. Yeah, thanks, Rob. So I think there were, you know, a few elements to that. So last year, I think in the March timeframe now, just going back, we introduced a price increase that was essentially for new customers. And so there was new pricing that was provided to new customers. And existing customers were then subject to an annual renewal uplift. And of course, if they made a new purchase, then the starting point, if you like, for them would be the new pricing. So that pricing has been well received through the year. As with any pricing change, it creates like a discussion point for customers. But I think it's now well embedded and well established. And I think what's more interesting for us is that as we look to the future and as we add to the portfolio of products that create this operations cloud, there's more opportunity for customers to be able to expand their footprint with us and for us to be able to, you know, ensure that they're using more of PagerDuty and we're consolidating some of the spend that's sitting out there. And that's really a great opportunity for us. Thanks again, guys. Appreciate it. Okay. Rounding things out, we're going to hear from Credit Suisse. I believe that's Tim Josovec, not Fred Lee. Hi. Thank you. This is Tim on for Fred. Appreciate you taking my questions. First, the midpoint of your Q1 revenue guidance implies 2 million sequential revenue growth, which is, I believe, the lowest sequential growth in Q1 you've seen since 2019. At the same time, your full year guidance implies sequential revenue growth slightly above what you reported last year. So, I was hoping you could walk us through the puts and takes of a relatively weaker Q1 guidance compared to a very healthy full year guide, especially given the environment you're operating in. Sure. So, you know, I think the key thing to remember is that Q1 last year was a particularly strong quarter for us. And as a result of that, the compare is a tougher compare. We have also just in thinking about the guidance that we've given for the full year, we're looking at the most recent set of circumstances in terms of thinking about how that may play out within the early part of the year. And we've tried to incorporate our views on the macro across the full year. So, as we move through the year, as we see those circumstances play out through the year, it does create a slightly different shift in the revenue through the period. And to be clear, are you assuming a recovery in the macro environment into the backup of the year in your guidance? It's a different set of compares, right? So, in terms of the compare from like Q1, which was a very strong quarter last year, versus say, you know, Q3 or Q4 later in the year, the compare is of a different base. No, it's probably safe to say that we're assuming the difficult macro environment is going to persist throughout the year, but we're confident in our ability to execute given how we're entering the year from a capacity standpoint, where we are in terms of new products to monetize and our competitive position. Thank you. And then as a follow-up for Jennifer, you announced a tight tech integration with ServiceNow CSM in January. Could you talk about the customer pool you're seeing in the CSOps arena? And how do you see the partnership with ServiceNow evolve over the next few years? Yeah, I mean, I think that in a number of cases, what we've seen is customers asking us how they can leverage their customer service agents to both help capture information as it's coming in from customers. I mean, unfortunately, many of our customers learn about major incidents from their end customers, either reaching out to their customer support teams or through social media or other channels. And so we had seen this demand from our customers to help leverage the customer support agents to engage on both identifying problems and being able to kick off incidents, but also being able to collaborate more closely with technology teams, engineering teams, software engineering teams, and service owners associated with the products and services that may be at the root of those incidents. And so bringing those two platforms together to help reduce the time that's lost and the customer impact that may be exposed or created because teams are working in disparate, separate platforms that don't talk to each other, it was a big part of the problem that was described to us. And then what we also see is with customers like Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zendesk, et cetera, there are opportunities where the platforms complement each other very well, where you might be using one platform in one part of the business for a certain type of work, but you still need a platform like PagerDuty that can help you manage mission critical, time sensitive, unstructured work, which is very different than what a ticketing queuing system or a CRM or a CSM product does. And so there's actually a lot of complement there. And really, this, again, has been driven by pull from the customer as opposed to strategic partnerships where our customer is saying, I need these systems to not just sit alongside each other nicely, I need them to work effectively together, I need to integrate the workflow across these to save my people time. Yeah, and just, you know, on that point, this was something that had already been validated by customers who were using the special integration we had done for Salesforce, ServiceCloud, and Zendesk, and ServiceNow CSM was the next piece, too, to Jen's point. Okay, team, excellent. We've reached the end of another call and questions. Jen, can I turn it over to you for some final remarks? Yes, you can. Well, first of all, I'd just like to say thank you for joining us today and for your questions. To recap, our fourth quarter results round out a strong year for PagerDuty, a year in which we extended our leadership in digital operations, surpassed $400 million in annual recurring revenue, and achieved non-gap profitability a year ahead of plan. I am confident in our operations cloud strategy reinforced by our recent innovation in AI and automation and in our team's ability to execute. Thank you to all of our employees around the world for championing our customers and delivering a successful year of profitable growth. Have a great day."

Adobe had a strong Q1, driving record revenue across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud businesses. We achieved $4.66 billion in revenue, representing 13% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $2.71 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.80. Digital is reshaping how we connect and engage with the world around us. Our performance demonstrates the critical role that Adobe products are playing in fueling the global digital economy, empowering everyone, everywhere, to imagine, create, and bring any digital experience to life. We're executing against our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity, and power digital businesses, delivering on our innovative product roadmap, and engaging a growing universe of customers, from individuals to small businesses to the largest enterprises. Given the recent news reports, I wanted to provide an update on the process and timing of our pending acquisition of Figma. We remain excited about the opportunity to advance product design, accelerate collaborative creativity on the web, and redefine the future of creativity and productivity. The potential combination continues to be well-received by customers, industry analysts, and partners. In addition, we're preparing for integration as we work through the regulatory process. From the outset, we have been well-prepared for all potential scenarios, while realistic about the regulatory environment. We have completed the discovery phase of the U.S. DOJ second request and are prepared for next steps, whether that is an approval or a challenge. Adobe remains confident in the facts underlying the case, and based on current process timing, we believe the transaction continues to be on track for a close by the end of 2023. It goes without saying that our Q1 success demonstrates that we continue to be ruthlessly focused on executing against our immense opportunities, independent of this combination. David, over to you. Thanks, Shatnu. Hello, everyone. We're living in a visual, digital first world where content creation and consumption are exploding and where consumers, students, and businesses need to create content that stands out and elevates their online profiles. As a result, more and more people are turning to Creative Cloud, which remains a preeminent destination for creativity across imaging, design, video, illustration, and animation, as well as new media types like 3D and augmented reality. We continue to see strong demand for our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat, and are excited about the traction we're getting with Adobe Express. Q1 was a strong quarter for Creative Cloud. We achieved net new creative ARR of $307 million and revenue of $2.76 billion, which grew 13% year over year. Q1 highlights include strong growth in top of funnel traffic, which resulted in healthy new demand for Creative Cloud applications across all routes to market and customer segments globally from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Increased demand and mobile adoption in imaging with products like Photoshop and Lightroom. Lightroom Mobile is now the default photo editor for the high-end photo editing experience on the Samsung Galaxy S23 series. Continued momentum for Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Frame.io, which are leaders in video editing and collaboration. Over two-thirds of films at Sundance, as well as Oscar winners Everything Everywhere All at Once and Navalny, were edited with our video products. Rapid adoption of Substance 3D by brands such as Amazon, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton. The Substance 3D team was honored with a technical Oscar in recognition of 3D capabilities that are making popular films such as Spider-Man, Star Wars, and Blade Runner 2049 possible. Acceleration in our Adobe stock business, driven by the demand for high-quality imaging, vector, video, and 3D content. Momentum for Adobe Express, with significant year-over-year growth in monthly active users across segments such as students, small businesses, and creative professionals. We are actively driving adoption of both new users and existing Creative Cloud subscribers who are now using Express when they want speed and ease. And we look forward to an imminent release of a dramatic upgrade with enhanced performance, integration functionality, and new authoring capabilities for video and mixed media. Exciting introduction of new products, including our beta releases of Character Animator and Adobe Podcast. Adobe Podcast is a web-based, AI-powered audio recording and editing app, perfect for the growing podcast industry. It makes every recording, even those done on your phone in busy spaces, sound like they were recorded in a studio. Key customer wins in the quarter include Accenture, BBC, Disney, IBM, Infosys, and Nintendo. Our innovation engine continues to fire on all cylinders to reimagine the future of creativity. Last October, we previewed some of Adobe's generative AI technology at max. We have been hard at work training Adobe models on our proprietary datasets, creating APIs, envisioning new services, and integrating all these capabilities into our existing applications as a creative copilot. These innovations are developed and deployed in alignment with Adobe's AI ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements slated for next week in conjunction with Adobe Summit. Digital documents are powering productivity at home and at work, whether users are filing a tax form, submitting a sales contract, requesting feedback on a marketing campaign, or completing an online bank transaction. Adobe Document Cloud is a leader in digital documents, redefining how people view, edit, share, scan, and sign documents across desktop, web, and mobile. In Q1, Document Cloud had record revenue of $634 million, which represents 16% year-over-year growth and strong net new ARR of $103 million, with ending ARR growing 22% year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 highlights include continued demand for PDF, with outstanding growth in documents opened in the Acrobat Chrome extension, and a new integration that will make Acrobat Reader the default PDF viewer in Microsoft Edge for over a billion Windows users. Extended growth in monthly active users for Acrobat Web, driven by search volume for PDF-related verbs and a continually optimized funnel to our web offering. Continued proliferation of Acrobat, driven by demand for integrated functionality such as share for review for collaboration and Adobe Sign for e-signatures. Outstanding increase in API transactions as our ecosystem and business customers continue to customize and integrate document services. Strong demand across all routes to market and customer segments globally, from individuals to SMBs to large enterprises. Key customer wins include Bank of Montreal, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Ministry of Defense of Netherlands, Samsung, and Verizon. Given the strong Q1, the demand for our products, and our innovation roadmap, we're pleased to raise our FY23 Digital Media Net New ARR target. I'll now pass it to Anil. Thanks David. Hello everyone. During the 2022 holiday season, e-commerce drove a record $211 billion, with 38 days of $3 plus billion in daily spend, according to the Adobe Digital Economy Index. Companies across B2B and B2C need an integrated customer experience management platform that empowers them to anticipate and meet the expectations of their customers. Today, digital is especially critical in enabling companies to drive profitable growth by delivering engaging and efficient customer experiences across the entire funnel, and Adobe is uniquely positioned to power experience-led growth.

In addition to unveiling exciting new technology innovation across Experience Cloud, we will host inspirational C-level executives from several companies at the forefront of the digital economy. I'll now pass it to Dan. Thanks Anil. Today I'll start by summarizing Adobe's performance in Q1, fiscal 2023, highlighting growth drivers across our businesses, and I'll finish with financial targets. Q1 was a strong start to the year for Adobe. I know the macro economy is on every investor's mind right now, and you can see the resilience and diversification of Adobe's business in our financial results. Businesses today are prioritizing investments in order to maximize returns and impact, both to drive their top line and to deliver operational efficiency. And individuals are looking to create content that enables them to connect and stand out across digital platforms. In this environment, the demand for our products continues to be strong as our solutions are mission critical to customers in a world where digital content and engagement drive the global economy. Our product differentiation, engine of innovation, and data-driven operating model are continuing to drive Adobe's growth. We have a world-class balance sheet, industry-leading margins, a strong cash flow profile, and a proven track record. I can't think of a company that's better positioned as we continue to innovate in our core business and create and scale emerging businesses to drive profitable growth. In Q1, Adobe achieved record revenue of $4.66 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. Business and financial highlights included gap-diluted earnings per share of $2.71 and non-gap-diluted earnings per share of $3.80. Digital media revenue of $3.40 billion, net new digital media ARR of $410 million, digital experience revenue of $1.18 billion, cash flows from operations of $1.69 billion, RPO of $15.21 billion exiting the quarter, and repurchasing approximately 5 million shares of our stock during the quarter. In our digital media segment, we achieved Q1 revenue of $3.40 billion, which represents 9% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. We exited the quarter with $13.67 billion of digital media ARR. We achieved creative revenue of $2.76 billion, which represents 8% year-over-year growth or 13% in constant currency. And we added $307 million of net new creative ARR in the quarter. Q1 creative growth drivers included new user growth fueled by customer demand and targeted marketing campaigns, which drove increased web traffic in the quarter. Adoption of our Creative Cloud All Apps offerings across customer segments and geographies. Students graduating from our education segment into the creative professional job market. Continued strength in upselling our new Acrobat CC offering, which includes integrated sign capabilities. Licensing of individual applications, including a strong quarter for our imaging and photography offerings. Momentum in high growth businesses such as substance and stock, where we had a tremendous quarter generating new business and with frame, which we are successfully cross-selling into our video customer base. And a fast start to the year selling into our large enterprise accounts. Adobe achieved document cloud revenue of $634 million, which represents 13% year-over-year growth or 16% in constant currency. We added $103 million of net new document cloud ARR in the quarter. Q1 document cloud growth drivers included continued growth of Acrobat Web, demonstrating the success of our product-led growth strategy. Strengthened conversion and retention rates of our Acrobat mobile customers. Demand for Acrobat subscriptions across all customer segments. Fast generating new customer demand for Acrobat sign and SMB in the mid-market. And strength in the enterprise, driving seed expansion for our Acrobat business. Turning to our digital experience segment, in Q1 we achieved revenue of $1.18 billion and subscription revenue of $1.04 billion, which represents 12% year-over-year growth or 14% in constant currency. Q1 digital experience growth drivers included success closing numerous transformational deals with large enterprises that are choosing Adobe to be their end-to-end CXM platform to drive personalization at scale. Momentum with our AEP and native applications, with the book of business growing more than 50% year-over-year. Strength with our content and work front solutions, as our content supply chain strategy is resonating with customers. Renewal rates of our enterprise customers that continue to be strong. And sales execution across multiple geographies. Turning to the income statement and balance sheet, in Q1 we continued with our strategy of making disciplined investments to drive growth, while identifying cost-saving opportunities to drive earnings. Adobe's effective tax rate in Q1 was 22% on a gap basis and 18.5% on a non-gap basis, in line with our expectations. For fiscal 2023, Adobe's management is adopting a fixed long-term projected non-gap tax rate to assess and report on operating results, which we believe provides a clear view of Adobe's financial performance. The fixed long-term non-gap rate considers our current operating structure, existing tax positions, legislation, and available forecast information. This rate is based on a three-year projection and may be adjusted for changes in the future. Our PO exiting the quarter was 15.21 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, or 13% when factoring in a three-percentage point FX headwind. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was 5.65 billion, and cash flows from operations in the quarter were 1.69 billion. Over the past year, we completed a thorough review of our short-term investments and marketable securities to ensure we are prepared for the current environment and with a bias towards the higher end of the investment grade spectrum. Adobe does not hold substantial assets or securities at Silicon Valley Bank or any regional bank. In Q1, we entered into a $1.4 billion share purchase agreement, and we currently have 5.2 billion remaining of our 15 billion authorization granted in December 2020, which goes through the end of fiscal 2024. In light of the strong start to the year and momentum across our business and factoring in the macroeconomic environment, for Q2, we're targeting total Adobe revenue of 4.75 to 4.78 billion, digital media net new ARR of approximately 420 million, digital media segment revenue of 3.45 to 3.47 billion, digital experience segment revenue of 1.21 to 1.23 billion, digital experience subscription revenue of 1.06 to 1.08 billion, tax rate of approximately 21.5% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.70, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.75 to $3.80. As a result of the strong performance in Q1 and trajectory of the business, we are raising our fiscal 2023 net new ARR and EPS targets. For fiscal 2023, we are now targeting digital media net new ARR of approximately 1.70 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $10.85 to $11.15, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $15.30 to $15.60. In summary, I'm pleased with our strong top line and bottom line execution in Q1, demonstrating the momentum we've established for the year. Our strong engine of innovation combined with our operational rigor are driving profitable growth and position us well to capture the massive growth opportunities at our doorstep. Shantanu, back to you. Thanks Dan. Adobe's Q1 results underscore our strong momentum and the significant opportunities we have across our businesses. We're thrilled to be back in Las Vegas for Adobe Summit next week. In addition to unveiling several new innovations across Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud, we will share how we are building on our decades of AI leadership to deliver generative AI technologies that redefine creativity and customer experiences. We look forward to seeing you there. Adobe's employees around the world motivate us to continuously raise the bar and create the future. This quarter we were named to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work, Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index for the fifth year in a row, and the CDPA list, which recognizes leadership and environmental impact. Our renowned brand, mission-critical products, and vast base of customers create an unmatched advantage that will fuel our growth. Thank you, and we will now take questions. Operator? Thank you. If you would like to ask a question, please signal by pressing star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, press star 1 to ask a question. Please limit yourselves to one question. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on a really strong start to the year. Dan, your guidance explicitly embeds assumptions for the macro environment. Can you share with us what those are and how those assumptions might have changed from a few months ago when you last guided? Thanks. Yeah, thanks, Brad. There's really no change in our view in the macro environment. I think we were pretty clear at the time we set our annual guidance, the environment that we're in. We see the environment that others see. I think you can see that the company is performing really well against that backdrop. So we feel good about how we're situated, the way in which we're engaging with customers, and its broad, diversified performance across that environment. And so we like how we're set up, but there's really no change to the assumptions underlying the macro environment. We see the same environment that others do. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from the line of Alex Zuckin with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Yeah. Hey, guys. So maybe just what do you think is the driving force behind it? So many companies are talking about longer sales cycles, difficulty closing business. You had an outstanding quarter specifically within the enterprise. So maybe what's driving those macro headwinds for others that you're not seeing or your resiliency specifically? And then on the topic of metrics, every metric was strong that we looked at, revenues, RPO, digital media, ARR, operating margins. But maybe just can you talk about deferred revenue in the quarter, anything there that was a headwind, because it did look like free cash flow was a little bit lighter than what we were expecting? I'll take the first, Alex, and then maybe Dan can speak to the second. I mean, I think, as Dan said, when we look at the macroeconomic situation, and you can see strong companies actually refer to this across the board, whether it's consumers, whether it's small and medium businesses, whether it's enterprises globally. I think the reality is that digital for them is an imperative and really for companies that have innovative solutions is a tailwind. I think what a lot of companies are focused on is the message that enterprises are certainly sharing is that if the prior focus was growth at any cost, certainly they're looking for more profitable growth. And I think if you look at our solutions on the creative document or enterprise side, we help them. We help them with growth, but we help them with profitable growth and engaging with customers. The second thing I would say is that there's a large dam here. And so I think our job in this environment is making sure that we have an even larger pipeline that we go address and attract, because there may be some difference in the closure rates. I think if you look at it in aggregate, our job is looking at it and saying, how do we differentiate ourselves? I think the one thing also I would say, Alex, is that a lot of the companies that have single product offerings, I think they are probably seeing more headwind because a certain company may not put one part of what they offer as a priority. And I think a lot of the companies are looking at it and saying, if we're engaging in digital, we might change our focus from content management to the implementation of the customer data platform, or they might be a focus more on campaigns or ensuring that the advertising spend, the attribution associated with it. So I think the team's executed against continuing to try and drive a large opportunity. The other thing I think we feel good about is the fact that both Summit as well as in the US and UK, we're looking forward to being in person because we can engage more in person with them. So hopefully that gives you some color of why perhaps the stronger companies are showing more macro strength than other companies. And Alex, I'll jump in on the second part of the question. So we think about RPO being up 13% year over year on a constant currency basis. We think about the underlying performance deferred revenue, unbilled backlog. It's very similar profile across both of those dimensions of the RPO. If you think about cash flow, the one thing I would point to, we all know that there's been a change in the tax regulation around capitalization of R&D expenses. We signaled at the time we set our annual targets that we would see a step up in cash taxes starting this quarter, and that's really what you see profiling through operating cash. Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats. If you find that your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the star key followed by the digit two. We'll take our next question from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. A really nice quarter. I think my question is actually a deep dive into the prior two questions. Dan, maybe digging a little bit into sort of what Brad was asking. We are, from a market perspective and investor perspective, worrying about these kind of incremental impacts like Silicon Valley Bank and other bank failures. We're seeing continued reduction in headcount from big shops like Meta on a go forward basis. I think the market is getting incrementally worried about the underlying macro impacts, but you guys went the other way. In a Q1, you're taking up your net new ARR additions for digital media. Can you walk us through specifically, is there anything mechanical or sort of tactical, if you will, that gives you guys the confidence that even with the heightened volatility that we're seeing out there that you guys feel comfortable in a Q1 taking up that full year guide? Then on the other side of the equation, on the free cash flow, can you just specify for us and give us a sense of kind of where those cash taxes are going to go over time just to help us kind of tune in our model? Yes. Let me take them in reverse order. In terms of cash taxes, there's a five-year amortization period around the capitalization of that R&D. You'll see a pretty dramatic cash tax step up initially, but over that five-year amortization period, it'll converge on the reported tax rate. That's the general profile. It's why you see the significant step up in Q1. It's just starting that process now. In terms of the environment we're in, clearly the company is performing well. You see the diversification of our business. That's across geographies, industry sectors, product portfolio. The company is just performing well in a broad-based way. On the strength of that performance and the momentum we have, the visibility we have into the full year, we think it's the prudent thing to set expectations with investors in a way that reflects what we see as the opportunity and the company's specific performance. When I take a step back and I think about what is driving that differential performance in this environment, I think our products are mission critical to our customers. We are on the critical path of them generating revenue. But as the world goes digital and those investments are prioritized, not only do we help companies drive top-line growth, but we help them with the underlying productivity gains that go with that. It is why customers in this environment are prioritizing around things that we sell to enable their success. It addresses top-line performance as well as underlying profitability of our customers. Being on the critical path, being mission critical to customers, we think this is the type of environment where the power of Adobe and the performance of the company gets to shine. I'll just add a little bit specific to digital media. The foundation of the growth that we have, we still feel a very significant tailwind even in this market. Shantanu talked about the strength of the enterprise business. Every business needs to be a digital business. Digital content is fueling the global economy. That's true for smaller organizations and individuals as well. If you look at the creator economy, we're seeing more people come in to start to create their own personal online brand. We saw a very strong digital funnel as well. We had the highest traffic that we've ever had come to Adobe.com. Even in small, medium businesses, the part of their business that they need to invest most in is the digital channel, as Dan was talking about. You look at that diversity. You then layer on the diversity of the growth drivers that we have in the business, whether it's new user acquisition, whether it's upsell of existing users, whether it's retention rates, whether it's new businesses like substance or stock, or the pricing and packaging opportunities that we have. Every one of those levers has been very productive for us. In terms of primary growth driver, it is and always has been new user acquisition. It is by far the biggest contributor. A lot of the PLG work that we've done over the last year, year and a half, is contributing to not just top of funnel, but also conversion of that top of funnel. In terms of upsell and migration, we've been investing for a decade or more in education. We have a very efficient channel now where students that graduate effectively upgrade and migrate into full-priced offerings. That drove a very strong Creative Cloud individual all-apps quarter for us. Retention, we've been doing a lot of work in retention through PLG, but we've also been driving a lot of utilization of Adobe Express as part of the Creative Cloud business. All of that combined makes for a very strong retention rate. New businesses, we talked about substance and frame having outsized growth. Of course, the pricing and packaging work that we've been doing all along continues to contribute to that, both for CC and Acrobat CC DC as a whole. Looking ahead, all of these drivers and these levers are intact, and we have lots of opportunities going forward as well. Maybe just putting it all together, if you look at it and say that, hey, we did 410 in Q1. We're targeting 420 of net new ARR in Q2. The question you would have asked us if we hadn't done this was, what are you signaling about the second half of the year? I think it's a way of showing that the momentum is there in the business. Super helpful. Thank you, guys. We'll take our next question from the line of Jake Robert with William Blair. Please go ahead. Hey, congrats on the great results. I just want to double-click on that retention commentary you said. You called it out in several areas of the business during the prepared remarks. Is there anything specific that you're doing differently in this period of macro uncertainty that's driving those results? Have you started to see Express help at all with retention metrics as customers now of its year that they can actually graduate down to? For a couple of years right now, we've been really focused on what we've called in the past the data-driven operating model and really being pretty focused on driving the business both with the narrative and the number. I think as we continue to, as David mentioned, have different products, and he's really focused on how we're acquiring them, how are we engaging them, what's the usage, how do we make sure they're getting value for the product, how do we continuously tell them about what's new. I think as David has come in and introduced the notion of product PLG, I think that part has also really started to reflect in making sure that customers know that we're building products and features that are relevant for the pain points that they have. I would say the underlying business, while they are the digital imperative, I wouldn't underestimate the incredible execution that the team continues to do on that or in DX. How do you look at the solutions we're selling? How do you understand cross-sell? How do you understand up-sell? I think the hours and hours of work that goes in is sometimes not appreciated, but I'm incredibly respectful and appreciative of what the teams have done. So a lot of execution is, I think, the short answer. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And we'll take the next question from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about that top of funnel activity that you've been generating here with Communicator and the consumer segment with Creative Cloud Express, the success you're seeing there, some exciting new announcements coming here, it sounds like, on Creative Cloud Express enhancements here. Could we interpret that to mean that perhaps you're pivoting more towards upselling those customers to some of these newer features and offerings that are coming with Creative Cloud Express away from that top of funnel activity that you've been very successful with so far? Thank you. Yeah, as Shantanu talked about, it's a holistic process. First of all, we've, over the last couple of years, spent a lot of time with product-led growth. What that gives us is confidence that when people come to Adobe.com and they get into the products, they're going to have a great onboarding experience. They're more likely to convert and they're more likely to stay, which then starts to give us more confidence and growth in terms of improving what has already been a world class in terms of lifetime value. As that happens, we've been running more targeted campaigns with things for Photoshop and Acrobat and Illustrator, as an example, that are more targeted to the growth activities and the landing pages in the products themselves. And we've actually been connecting all of our outbound marketing activities with landing pages in the products themselves. So we have been able to really increase our demand efforts and the ROI associated with that to bring more traffic to Top of Funnel. In addition to that, we have been investing a lot in growth loops. So people are able to now, when using the products, actually share the content out to stakeholders. Those stakeholders are able to look at that content, but also become Top of Funnel opportunity for us. So if you look at Acrobat Web, as an example, we've seen a massive increase in terms of Acrobat Web usage driven by things like Share for Review. So that drives more Top of Funnel for us. And then third is partnerships. We've been working very closely with Microsoft, as an example. We've announced that Reader, as an example, will be the default PDF viewer in Edge, which now gives us access to over a billion users on Windows-based devices. So it's a cacophony of these activities that ultimately results in strong Top of Funnel. And then, as we talked about, it's really about the hard work and the data to drive personalized experiences at scale, leveraging a lot of Anil's DX businesses and products to drive users all the way through to conversion. Wonderful to hear. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from the line of Michael Turin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Hey, great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. One of the things that stood out is you mentioned wins over single product competitors in a few key areas on the digital experience side. Can we go a bit deeper into that as this environment and some of what's happening on the private company side, maybe presenting opportunities you're now able to take advantage of? I'd just be curious to hear a bit more on maybe both the DX and DM side, just what's happening there. Thank you. Yeah, let me start on the digital experience side. We have a broad and comprehensive portfolio, and it's integrated with the Adobe Experience platform. So from a customer perspective, they get the best of both worlds. They get those best-in-class applications, whether it's content and commerce or customer journeys or data insights or workflow, marketing workflow, and they get the benefit of integration with the Adobe Experience platform and the native apps that we've built there. So that's a powerful combination. It helps to really address what Shantanu was talking about, which is how do you keep growing through your digital channels and you get the revenue growth, but you also get the benefit of getting efficiency through consolidation. And that's where we believe we really shine as customers are looking at their overall stack, similar to what they've done in other aspects of their IT enterprise architecture. They're looking at who is my go-to platform that I can really standardize on and I'll build around, and so we are getting the benefit of that choice. And on the DME side, we look at just all the energy in the market around single product players, whether it's a mobile app, whether it's a web app, or whether it's this incredible excitement that we have as well around generative AI, really as focused on driving top of funnel because it's driving a lot of awareness of creativity and the things that people want to do. And ultimately, as they leverage those apps, as they see themselves as more creative, they inevitably end up at our doorstep going forward. And we'll take our next question from the line of Cash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Thank you very much. I just want to pick up where I think David talked about the excitement with generative AI. Anybody that wants to jump in, what does this mean for Adobe? Is this just somewhat substitutive for all the opportunity that you have, or is it somewhat incremental or massively incremental? And how does Adobe monetize generative AI? Is this something that you can create a separate SKU or charge more? I'm curious to get your thoughts quantitatively and qualitatively. Thank you so much. Cash, I think there was about three or four questions, but all related. So happy to take those really quickly. Nicely played. First of all, this is really about increasing the total number of users, we believe very strongly. As we talked about at Max, this is about enhancing human creativity, not replacing it. And ultimately, whether you're an individual, solopreneur, SMB, or enterprise, we're hearing the same thing, which is that you need to create more content than you're able to create today. And so this really plays well into our core strengths. As you know, we've got a decades-long focus on AI, things like neural filters and object selection and hundreds of other features have been based on AI for us. And they've increased creativity and they've increased productivity, and they've helped people keep up with the demand for content. They've also made it easier for people to onboard into the experiences. And so we've been able to broaden the opportunity for people to start leveraging and using our core products. We've now been able to leverage the hundreds of people that are in our research organization and really target them towards generative technology, which we believe is a huge step forward, leveraging all the work we've done, but a huge step forward going forward. And we and everyone else in the industry are still in the early innings. So to give you a sense of where we're going at max, we talked about our vision for effectively not just creating content, but really engaging and embedding it in the existing workflows to create a creative copilot, we refer to it as. And since then, we've been very hard at work at creating our own model. And the model that we're focused on is around output quality. So it's about best of breed generative AI, but combining that with the Adobe magic that we've talked about over the years, and all the technology we have that takes images and makes them better. And so the output quality we think is going to be differentiated. The second thing is around commercial reuse. There's a lot of complex questions here around copyrights, around diversity and inclusion, about harmful content that's being created. That's something we take very seriously, and we're embedding that into everything we do. And the third thing is really about workflow integration. Creating an image is just the start. It's not the end. And Adobe is the only player that has full end to end workflow, not just within the products and the tools that we have in the digital media business, but also everything that Anil is doing around the content workflow and the content supply chain out to the point of distribution. And in fact, because of this, we're seeing other gen tech companies wanting to partner with us more and more. And so we feel like we're in a really advantaged position where we're going to come out with our own model, and we're going to be partnering with others to make sure that because of our distribution and the place we play in the market, we can bring a lot of this value to actual fruition. And stay tuned. Next week at Summit, we have a lot of exciting announcements and progress to make there. And then last to your, I think, fourth or fifth question. Monetization. Monetization. We're very excited about what this means for the business. New user onboarding, we think that again, if you can start to imagine yourself as creative by using a text prompt, we can take you through that full journey and onboard you into other Adobe offerings. It's also great for retention. We've always seen the more value that gets used in our core offerings, the better the retention rates and the better the LTV. And we think there's upsell opportunity. We do think these are distinct new packages that we can bring to market and upsell people with it. And we'll take our next question from the line of Jay Vlishauer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good evening. David, for you first, when we spoke at Max on the subject of monetization, you alluded to Adobe's plans for new pricing and packaging, and you alluded to that this evening. But there was a third ingredient that you also alluded to at the time, which was segmentation, which sounded to me like something that you had success with back in the pre-CC days. And so is this something that you could talk about in terms of your returning to the segmentation techniques of the past that worked rather well for the company? And then for Anil, it's interesting to hear the reference to your competition with single product companies. That's not a new phenomenon, of course. You've had multi-solution DX portfolio for some time. So would you say, therefore, that the wins or magnitude of the wins against single product competitors is more pronounced now? It's a larger part of the DX business. And would you say that the investments that you've evidently been making over the last year in consulting capacity has been a critical enabling ingredient for the growth you're now seeing in DX? Yeah. So starting with the DME side, Jay, for broad understanding, what we talked about at Adobe Max was this recognition that since we introduced Creative Cloud 10 or 11 years ago, we have now a much more comprehensive set of capabilities, all the way from a freemium model with Adobe Express, all the way to our high-end Creative Cloud offerings, but also additional capabilities and packages beyond that, like Substance and like Frame and like Stock, that allow people to go beyond what they can do with the core creative products. The second thing that, in addition to that expansion that's happened, is that as we've been driving more with D-DOM and more with product-led growth, we are starting to automatically segment customers, not necessarily today in terms of what they buy, but how they experience the products that they're using already. And so what that leads to is an opportunity, and again, going back to all the levers that we have for ongoing growth, there's the opportunity to start segmenting them earlier in the purchase flow into offers that meet their needs and optimize the value to the price in a way that benefits our customers and, of course, also benefits Adobe. So you can expect to see us continuing to play with everything from how we get new users, how we upsell users, how we retain them, new businesses we bring in, but also pricing and packaging, to your point. And just to punctuate that maybe a little bit, Jay, I mean, the reality is that we actually have different pricing for different devices today, which is completely different. We have web-based pricing for people who come and experience this as a result of a web search that they've made, most successfully through Acrobat Web, for example. And so if the question is, when we had things like design collection or web collection or video collection, I mean, the reality is the CC All Apps, which actually had a really good quarter, is perceived by people to be the new sort of table stakes for what is happening in creative. And we think that that's a great offering. And as David said, I mean, whether it's stock or whether it is substance and a 3D offerings, what we are doing there, those are really perceived to be the differential offerings that are personalized. And for a Photoshop customer, how do we get them to use one of these other offerings? So I think we've done a really good job on that particular front. Yeah, from the DX perspective, we obviously started investing in AEP five years ago. Now we have lots of examples of customers who are using some of the capabilities like unified profile or real-time CDP and the real-time performance at scale in production. So from a customer's perspective, if they think about a single product, they actually know what an integrated product looks like, and they realize that that's what they would have to build together, build on their own. So I think that's making the choice of going with a product from Adobe, which is already integrated with also best-in-class application, versus a single product where they would have to put it together. I think that's making the contrast more stark. And there's more scrutiny, wouldn't you say, Anil? So I think part of what's happening is as the IT or the chief marketing officer, the chief digital officer is thinking about this holistically, there's more scrutiny around who is the company that can provide us the more comprehensive solution. So that you have seen, Jay, a certain difference in how customers are viewing that, which again plays to our strengths. Thank you. And we'll take our next question from the line of Seket Kaliya with Barclays. Please go ahead. Okay, great. Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question here, and well done on the quarter as well. I'd love to dig into Figma a little bit, understanding very well that it's still in process. And so, David, maybe for you, I know you and the team see the opportunities with products like Fake Jam in really complementing Creative Cloud. I was wondering if you've seen other opportunities for some of that complementary sort of opportunity as you've spent more time with the business. And then, Dan, maybe just a quick housekeeping question. Can you just remind us sort of what the revenue overlap looks like with Figma? I believe it's the Adobe XD product where specifically where there's overlap, but maybe you could just remind us sort of what that revenue overlap looks like. Yes, Hakeet, maybe I'll first jump in. I mean, I think, just let's remember before they answer, these are two separate companies. And so, we are operating at arm's length in terms of what they are doing. I think we've shared up front that the XD revenue is de minimis. And so, that's the part that I wanted to get across. And then, David can certainly speak to some of the strategic rationale and ideas for what we can do. Yeah. So, I think there's a ton of opportunity in terms of how we look at the Figma business and figure out Figma opportunity. First of all, as we've discussed, we believe that we can just fundamentally accelerate what they are doing today in product design. We have a global footprint. We are working with a lot of our, with enterprise customers across the globe. And the feedback that we're getting from these enterprise customers is a lot of excitement about the kinds of things we can do by bringing these two companies together to just accelerate, make them more productive in terms of what they want to accomplish, and just accelerate everything that they're doing. The second thing is around taking workflows between Photoshop and Illustrator and Figma, and really just operationalizing them in a way that we can bring real-time collaboration capabilities based on the Figma platform to the core disciplines like illustration and video editing and photography and 3D design and more. And the third is really around the evolution with FigJam, bringing that into the core for productivity use cases. So, taking FigJam and integrating it more deeply with things like Acrobat and starting to just recognize that creativity is starting to be the foundation of how new productivity applications need to present themselves. And that whole motion of enabling productivity workers to express themselves creatively is where the market's going with the rise of the creator economy. And so, we just see a ton of opportunities to integrate the products. We can't, we're limited in what we can talk to them about in the moment, but what I can say is everyone from Adobe employees to Figma employees to our customers can't wait for this to close so we can actually get moving on all this. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Hey, operator, we're just about at the top of the hour. We'll take one more question, please. Thank you. We'll take our next question from the line of Brent Thale with Jeffries. Please go ahead. It's Sean Neu on the DX business. I'm just curious if you could just give us an overview of what you're seeing there. Are you still seeing the big deals? Are you seeing a higher number of smaller transactions? Can you just talk through the pipeline, just general kind of setup, what you're seeing in terms of the overall DX business and how customers are behaving? Happy to, Brent, and I hope we get to see you next week at Summit because then you'll also get to meet a whole bunch of customers. I think, and Anil, certainly feel free to add. I think we saw some really good transformational deals. I think both Dan and Anil referred to that. Companies that are looking at Adobe to help them with their entire end-to-end customer experience management, good strength there, Brent. Those tend to be ones that we have worked with for many years and some that are really looking at it as a strategic. I would say that segment, the pipeline associated with people who are looking for a comprehensive and integrated CXM solution is pretty large. I think as it relates to what we call the solution-led segment as well, which is people who may have our analytic solutions and want content solutions or those who have both of those and want journey optimizer or customer journey analytics or certainly the commerce solutions, that's another part of the business where we are making sure that we can upsell. I know Anil typically at every FA meeting gives you stats and metrics on how we're making progress. So that is one. Given we have the customer relationship and we have the customer engagement and we have customer success managers, I think continuing to penetrate a customer account, that's where also we see pipeline and that's pipeline that's driven, frankly, by us. I think in terms of the geographies, we continue to see strength in North America. I think when you think about EMEA, that remains an area of strength. There are some areas in Asia, some countries in Asia. So our job there really, Brent, has been how do you drive a large pipeline, understanding that there's going to be different companies that look at this differently in a specific quarter but we are focused on the addressable market. Anil, I don't know if you have other stuff to add. I think the only thing I would say is I think the themes that we're going to hit on at Summit, personalization at scale, content supply chain, even for customers who are starting with a single product, they like that vision because they know that that is what is key to driving the digital growth and driving profitable growth. So even if they're starting with one and focusing on value realization, they have their eye on a longer-term roadmap and that benefits our relationship with them. And Brent, the other thing I'll say, given this the last question, is I think at Summit you'll see some of the themes. Certainly content has been a theme for us for a long time. Data has been a theme for us for a long time. The focus on customer platform and CDP has been a big one. I think how this spreads its tentacles into the product and PLG, as David has said. So I think we have some exciting things that we'll talk about in that particular space in AI and how AI can help. So we're not just resting on what we have today as an integrated offering. We're really the innovative product roadmap across each one of our businesses. What David's been doing in creative, what's happening in documents on the web and mobile devices and what Anil's going to show. I think that's also what gives us a lot of confidence that we're anticipating and solving customer problems. And so it was a strong start to Q1. And based on the product innovation, we really continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have at Adobe. And we look forward to seeing all of you at Summit. Thanks everyone for joining the call. Like Shantanu said, we hope to see many of you next Tuesday at Summit. I look forward to talking to many of you soon. And this concludes the call. Thank you. This does conclude today's meeting. Thank you for your attendance. And you may now disconnect."
